  "summary": "This code is a Vite plugin that blocks CommonJS (CJS) modules from being imported in a Vite project. The plugin scans the project's source code for CJS modules and throws an error if any are found. It also checks for external imports that could trip up the CJS compiler and verifies that they are safe to use. \n\nThe plugin works by first defining an array of allowed CJS modules. It then scans the project's source code for CJS modules that are not in the allowed list. If any are found, the plugin throws an error. \n\nThe plugin also checks for external imports that could trip up the CJS compiler. It does this by scanning the project's source code for external imports that were imported either as default, using *, or dynamically. If any are found, the plugin adds them to a list of imports to check. \n\nAt the end of the build process, the plugin checks the list of external imports to see if any of them are CJS modules that have not been verified. If any are found, the plugin throws an error. \n\nThis plugin is useful for preventing dev -> prod inconsistencies in Vite when handling CJS modules. It ensures that all external imports are safe to use and that the project only uses allowed CJS modules. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```javascript\nimport blockCjsPlugin from 'vite-plugin-block-cjs';\n\nexport default {\n  plugins: [\n    blockCjsPlugin,\n  ],\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a Vite plugin called `blockCjsPlugin` that scans for CommonJS dependencies and blocks them by default due to inconsistencies in Vite when handling CJS.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `ALLOWED_CJS_MODULES` array?\n- The `ALLOWED_CJS_MODULES` array contains a list of CommonJS modules that are allowed to be imported, even though CommonJS dependencies are blocked by default.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `externalImportsToCheck` object?\n- The `externalImportsToCheck` object is used to keep track of external imports that could potentially trip up the CommonJS compiler, so that they can be checked to ensure that they are safe to use."
