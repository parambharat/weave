  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the Weave project's build tool, Vite. It sets up various plugins and options for Vite to use during development and production builds. \n\nThe `defineConfig` function is used to define the configuration object that Vite will use. The configuration object is defined as a function that takes in an object with two properties: `mode` and `command`. `mode` specifies whether the build is for development or production, while `command` specifies the command that was used to run the build (e.g. `serve`, `build`, etc.).\n\nThe configuration object sets up various plugins to be used by Vite. These plugins include `svgr`, `vite-plugin-block-cjs`, `vite-plugin-file-urls`, and `rollup-plugin-visualizer`. The `react` plugin is also used, but only in development mode. \n\nThe configuration object also sets up various options for Vite. These options include `base`, `resolve`, `optimizeDeps`, `server`, `preview`, `build`, `envPrefix`, `cacheDir`, and `assetsInclude`. \n\nOverall, this code is responsible for configuring Vite to work with the Weave project. It sets up various plugins and options that are specific to the project's needs. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';\nimport svgr from 'vite-plugin-svgr';\nimport blockCjsPlugin from './vite-plugin-block-cjs';\nimport fileUrls from './vite-plugin-file-urls';\nimport { visualizer } from 'rollup-plugin-visualizer';\n\nexport default defineConfig(({ mode, command }) => {\n  const plugins = [svgr(), blockCjsPlugin, fileUrls];\n\n  if (mode !== 'production') {\n    plugins.unshift(\n      react({\n        jsxRuntime: 'classic',\n      })\n    );\n  }\n\n  if (command === 'build') {\n    plugins.push(visualizer());\n  }\n\n  return {\n    plugins,\n    base: mode === 'production' ? '/my-app/' : '/',\n    server: {\n      port: 3000,\n    },\n    build: {\n      outDir: 'dist',\n    },\n  };\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `modifyEnvPlugin` function and how is it used?\n    \n    The `modifyEnvPlugin` function is a Vite plugin that modifies the contents of `env.js` during development. It replaces the string `'/__weave'` with `'http://localhost:9994/__weave'` in the code of `env.js`. This is used to route requests to the Weave server on a fixed port.\n\n2. Why is the `react` plugin only enabled in development mode?\n    \n    The `react` plugin is only enabled in development mode because it requires Babel, which is slow. To make sure the behavior is the same in both environments, the new JSX runtime is not used in development mode. Instead, the classic runtime is used, which is equivalent to the production environment where JSX transpilation is handled by esbuild.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `alias` array in the Vite configuration?\n    \n    The `alias` array is used to allow absolute imports inside the `weave` package. It maps module names to file paths, so that when a module is imported using a certain name, Vite knows where to find the corresponding file. It also maps some third-party modules to different paths, for example `react-datetime` and `react-virtualized`."
