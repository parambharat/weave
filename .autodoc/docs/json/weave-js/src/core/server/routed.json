  "summary": "The code defines two classes, `Router` and `RoutedServer`, that are used for routing queries to different servers in a larger project called `weave`. \n\nThe `Router` class takes in an array of `Server` objects, an `OpStore` object, and a routing function that maps a `Node` object to a `Server`. The `route` method of the `Router` class takes a `Node` object as input and returns the `Server` object that the routing function maps the node to. If the returned server is not included in the array of servers passed to the constructor, an error is thrown. \n\nThe `RoutedServer` class implements the `Server` interface and takes in a `Router` object and an `OpStore` object. The `query` method of the `RoutedServer` class takes an array of `Node` objects and an optional boolean flag as input. It first groups the nodes by the server they are mapped to by the router, and then sends a query to each server with the corresponding nodes. The results are then combined into a single array and returned. The `debugMeta` method returns an object with metadata about the `RoutedServer` object and its `OpStore`. \n\nThese classes are used to enable routing of queries to different servers based on the nodes being queried. This can be useful in a distributed system where different servers may have different capabilities or data. For example, if the nodes being queried represent different regions, the router can map them to servers that are geographically closer to the regions, reducing latency and improving performance. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst servers = [server1, server2, server3]; // array of Server objects\nconst opStore = new OpStore(); // create an OpStore object\nconst router = new Router(servers, opStore, (node) => {\n  // routing function that maps nodes to servers based on some criteria\n  if (node.region === 'east') {\n    return servers[0];\n  } else if (node.region === 'west') {\n    return servers[1];\n  } else {\n    return servers[2];\n  }\n});\nconst routedServer = new RoutedServer(router, opStore); // create a RoutedServer object\nconst nodes = [node1, node2, node3]; // array of Node objects\nroutedServer.query(nodes).then((results) => {\n  // process results\n}).catch((error) => {\n  // handle error\n});\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Router` class?\n- The `Router` class is responsible for routing nodes to the appropriate server based on a provided routing function.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `RoutedServer` class?\n- The `RoutedServer` class is a server implementation that uses a `Router` instance to route queries to the appropriate server based on the nodes being queried.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `query` method in the `RoutedServer` class?\n- The `query` method in the `RoutedServer` class is responsible for querying the appropriate server for each node in the input array of nodes, and returning the results in the order of the input nodes."
