  "summary": "The code defines a class called `LocalServer` that implements the `Server` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a local server for executing graph operations. The `LocalServer` class has two properties: `opStore` and `engine`. The `opStore` property is an instance of the `OpStore` class, which is used to store and manage graph operations. The `engine` property is an instance of the `Engine` class, which is responsible for executing graph operations.\n\nThe `LocalServer` constructor takes three parameters: `cache`, `backend`, and `trace`. The `cache` parameter is an instance of the `Cache` class, which is used to cache graph operations. The `backend` parameter is an instance of the `ServerAPI` class, which is used to communicate with the backend server. The `trace` parameter is an optional parameter of type `Tracer`, which is used to trace the execution of graph operations.\n\nThe `LocalServer` class has two methods: `query` and `debugMeta`. The `query` method takes two parameters: `nodes` and `resetBackendExecutionCache`. The `nodes` parameter is an array of `Node` objects, which represent the graph operations to be executed. The `resetBackendExecutionCache` parameter is an optional boolean parameter that indicates whether the backend execution cache should be reset before executing the graph operations. The `query` method returns a promise that resolves to an array of results from executing the graph operations.\n\nThe `debugMeta` method returns an object that contains debugging information about the `LocalServer` instance. The object has two properties: `id` and `opStore`. The `id` property is a string that identifies the `LocalServer` instance. The `opStore` property is an object that contains debugging information about the `OpStore` instance associated with the `LocalServer` instance.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide a local server for executing graph operations. The `LocalServer` class can be instantiated with a `Cache` instance, a `ServerAPI` instance, and an optional `Tracer` instance. The `query` method can be used to execute graph operations and the `debugMeta` method can be used to obtain debugging information about the `LocalServer` instance.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LocalServer` class?\n- The `LocalServer` class is a server implementation that provides a `query` method for executing nodes and a `debugMeta` method for retrieving debug metadata.\n\n2. What dependencies does the `LocalServer` class have?\n- The `LocalServer` class depends on the `Cache`, `ServerAPI`, `Engine`, `Node`, `OpStore`, `Tracer`, and `Server` types, as well as the `GlobalCGEventTracker` and `BasicEngine` classes.\n\n3. What is the role of the `opStore` property in the `LocalServer` class?\n- The `opStore` property in the `LocalServer` class is a reference to the `OpStore` instance used by the `BasicEngine` instance created in the constructor. It is used in the `debugMeta` method to retrieve debug metadata."
