  "summary": "The code defines a class called `ServerWithShadow` that implements the `Server` interface. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to query two servers simultaneously, with one server acting as a \"shadow\" of the other. \n\nThe constructor takes in two `Server` objects, `mainServer` and `shadowServer`, and an optional `OpStore` object. If an `OpStore` object is provided, it is used as the `opStore` property of the `ServerWithShadow` instance. Otherwise, the `opStore` property is set to the `opStore` property of the `mainServer` object.\n\nThe `query` method takes in an array of `Node` objects and an optional boolean flag `resetBackendExecutionCache`. It first increments a counter in a `GlobalCGEventTracker` object to keep track of the number of shadow server requests. It then calls the `query` method of the `shadowServer` object with the same arguments, but does not wait for the result (i.e. it \"fires and forgets\" the request). Finally, it returns the result of calling the `query` method of the `mainServer` object with the same arguments.\n\nThe `debugMeta` method returns an object with debugging information about the `ServerWithShadow` instance, including its `id`, the debugging information of the `mainServer` and `shadowServer` objects, and the debugging information of the `opStore` object.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to improve the reliability and performance of server queries. By using a shadow server, the `ServerWithShadow` instance can detect if the main server is down or returning incorrect results, and switch to using the shadow server instead. This can help prevent downtime and improve the user experience. Additionally, by querying both servers simultaneously, the `ServerWithShadow` instance can improve query performance by returning the result from the main server as soon as it is available, while still allowing the shadow server to continue processing the query in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst mainServer = new MyServer();\nconst shadowServer = new MyServer();\nconst serverWithShadow = new ServerWithShadow(mainServer, shadowServer);\n\nconst nodes = [new Node('node1'), new Node('node2')];\nconst results = await serverWithShadow.query(nodes);\nconsole.log(results);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ServerWithShadow` class?\n- The `ServerWithShadow` class implements the `Server` interface and acts as a proxy server that forwards queries to both a main server and a shadow server.\n\n2. What is the `opStore` property used for?\n- The `opStore` property is used to store and retrieve operations for the main server. If an `opStore` is provided during initialization, it is used, otherwise the `opStore` of the main server is used.\n\n3. Why is the `catch` method used in the `query` method?\n- The `catch` method is used to handle any rejected promises from the shadow server's query method. The rejection is logged to the console, but the error is not propagated further since it is not considered a critical error."
