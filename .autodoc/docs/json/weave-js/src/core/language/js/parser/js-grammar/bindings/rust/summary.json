      "summary": "This code provides support for the weave language in the tree-sitter parsing library. The `language()` function is used to add the weave language to a tree-sitter parser, which can then be used to parse code written in the weave language. The `language()` function returns the tree-sitter `Language` for the weave grammar. \n\nTo use this code, you would first create a new parser using `tree_sitter::Parser::new()`. Then, you would call `parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language())` to add the weave language to the parser. Finally, you would call `parser.parse(code, None)` to parse some code written in the weave language. \n\nThe `NODE_TYPES` constant provides the content of the `node-types.json` file for this grammar. This file defines the types of nodes that can be present in the parse tree for the weave language. \n\nThe code also includes commented-out constants for any queries that this grammar contains. These queries can be used to extract specific information from the parse tree, such as highlighting information or tag information. \n\nThe `tests` module includes a single test that verifies that the weave language can be loaded by a tree-sitter parser. \n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary support for parsing code written in the weave language using the tree-sitter parsing library.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code provides weave language support for the tree-sitter parsing library. It defines a language function that adds the language to a tree-sitter parser and provides the content of the node-types.json file for this grammar.\n\n2. How do you use this code to parse some code?\n   \n   You can use the tree-sitter parser to parse some code by setting the language to tree_sitter_weave::language() and then calling the parser.parse() function with the code to parse.\n\n3. What are the other queries that this grammar contains?\n   \n   This code includes commented out constants for other queries that this grammar contains, including HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY, INJECTIONS_QUERY, LOCALS_QUERY, and TAGS_QUERY."

  "summary": "The `lib.rs` file in the `rust` folder provides support for the Weave language in the Tree-sitter parsing library. Tree-sitter is a parsing library that generates syntax trees for source code, making it easier to analyze and manipulate the structure of the code. The Weave language is a custom language that needs to be added to the Tree-sitter parser to enable parsing of Weave code.\n\nThe primary function in this file is `language()`, which returns the Tree-sitter `Language` for the Weave grammar. To use this function, you would first create a new parser using `tree_sitter::Parser::new()`. Then, you would call `parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language())` to add the Weave language to the parser. Finally, you would call `parser.parse(code, None)` to parse some code written in the Weave language. Here's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```rust\nuse tree_sitter::Parser;\nuse tree_sitter_weave;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new();\n    parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language()).unwrap();\n    let code = \"some Weave code\";\n    let tree = parser.parse(code, None).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", tree.root_node());\n}\n```\n\nThe `NODE_TYPES` constant provides the content of the `node-types.json` file for this grammar. This file defines the types of nodes that can be present in the parse tree for the Weave language. This information is useful for developers who want to analyze or manipulate the parse tree generated by the Tree-sitter parser.\n\nThe code also includes commented-out constants for any queries that this grammar contains. These queries can be used to extract specific information from the parse tree, such as highlighting information or tag information. Developers can uncomment these constants and use them to perform advanced operations on the parse tree.\n\nThe `tests` module includes a single test that verifies that the Weave language can be loaded by a Tree-sitter parser. This test ensures that the Weave language support is functioning correctly and can be used in other parts of the project.\n\nIn summary, the `lib.rs` file in the `rust` folder provides the necessary support for parsing code written in the Weave language using the Tree-sitter parsing library. This support enables developers to analyze and manipulate Weave code in a structured manner, making it easier to work with the Weave language in the larger project.",
