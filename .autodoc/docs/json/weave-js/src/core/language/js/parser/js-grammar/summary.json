      "summary": "The code defines a grammar for the `weave` language, which is a part of a larger project. The grammar is used to parse and analyze the source code written in the `weave` language. It defines various rules, tokens, and constructs that are used to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the source code.\n\nThe grammar is organized into several sections:\n\n1. **Export and Import declarations**: These rules define the syntax for exporting and importing modules in the `weave` language. They include `export_statement`, `import_statement`, and related constructs.\n\n2. **Statements**: This section defines the various types of statements that can be used in the `weave` language, such as `if_statement`, `for_statement`, `while_statement`, and others.\n\n3. **Expressions**: This section defines the various types of expressions that can be used in the `weave` language, such as `assignment_expression`, `binary_expression`, `ternary_expression`, and others.\n\n4. **Primitives**: This section defines the primitive data types and literals in the `weave` language, such as `number`, `string`, `regex`, and others.\n\n5. **Expression components**: This section defines the components that make up expressions in the `weave` language, such as `arguments`, `decorator`, `class_body`, and others.\n\nThe grammar also defines several helper functions, such as `commaSep1` and `commaSep`, which are used to create sequences of elements separated by commas.\n\nHere's an example of how the grammar can be used to parse a simple `weave` code snippet:\n\n```weave\nimport { foo } from './module';\nexport const bar = foo + 1;\n```\n\nThe grammar would parse this code into an AST with nodes representing the import statement, export statement, and the various expressions and identifiers used in the code. This AST can then be used for further analysis, transformation, or code generation.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `weave` grammar in this code?**\n\n   The `weave` grammar in this code defines the structure and rules for parsing a programming language or a domain-specific language called \"weave\". It specifies the various constructs, expressions, and statements that are valid in the language, as well as their precedence and associativity.\n\n2. **How are comments handled in this code?**\n\n   Comments are handled using the `comment` rule, which is defined as a token that starts with `/*`, followed by any sequence of characters that does not form the `*/` closing delimiter, and ends with `*/`. This rule allows for C-style multiline comments in the \"weave\" language.\n\n3. **What are the different types of expressions supported in this code?**\n\n   The code supports various types of expressions, including primary expressions, assignment expressions, augmented assignment expressions, await expressions, unary expressions, binary expressions, ternary expressions, update expressions, new expressions, and yield expressions. These expressions can be combined and nested to form more complex expressions in the \"weave\" language."

This AST can then be used for various purposes, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring.\n\nThe code defines a function called `tree_sitter_weave()` that returns a pointer to a `TSLanguage` struct. This struct contains information about the syntax of the Weave programming language, such as the names of the different types of nodes in the AST and the rules for parsing the source code. This function is declared as `extern \"C\"` to ensure that it has a C-style function signature, which is required by the Tree-sitter library.\n\nThe code also defines a function called `Init()` that is used to initialize the language binding. This function creates a new `FunctionTemplate` object that is used to define a constructor function for the language binding.

TERNARY_QMARK is used to recognize the ternary operator (a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement).\n\nThe scanner is implemented as a set of functions that are called by the main parser when it encounters a token that matches one of the defined types. The functions use the TSLexer interface provided by Tree-sitter to read and manipulate the input stream of characters.\n\nThe scan_template_chars function scans the input stream for a template literal and returns true if one is found. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input stream and looking for the backtick character that marks the end of the literal. Along the way, it also recognizes the ${} syntax used to embed expressions inside the literal.\n\nThe scan_whitespace_and_comments function skips over any whitespace or comments that appear in the input stream. It recognizes both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments.\n\nThe scan_automatic_semicolon function recognizes semicolons that are automatically inserted by the JavaScript interpreter. It does this by looking for certain patterns of characters that indicate the end of a statement. For example, it recognizes semicolons that appear before a closing brace (}), before a comma (,), or before certain operators (+, -, etc.). It also recognizes special cases like the ++ and -- operators, which require a semicolon to be inserted after them.\n\nThe scan_ternary_qmark function recognizes the ternary operator (a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement). It does this by looking for the ? character that marks the beginning of the operator, and then checking for certain patterns of characters that indicate the end of the operator. For example, it recognizes cases where the operator is followed by a period (.) and a digit.\n\nOverall, this scanner provides additional functionality to the main parser by recognizing certain types of tokens that are not handled by the default scanner provided by the Tree-sitter library.

Here is an example of how this code can be used to parse a simple input program:\n\n```c\n#include \"tree_sitter/parser.h\"\n\nenum TokenType {\n  NUMBER,\n  PLUS,\n  MINUS,\n  TIMES,\n  DIVIDE,\n};\n\nvoid *tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_create() { return NULL; }\nvoid tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_destroy(void *p) {}\nunsigned tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_serialize(void *p, char *buffer) { return 0; }\nvoid tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_deserialize(void *p, const char *buffer, unsigned length) {}\n\nbool tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_scan(void *payload, TSLexer *lexer, const bool *valid_symbols) {\n  if (isdigit(lexer->lookahead)) {\n    lexer->result_symbol = NUMBER;\n    while (isdigit(lexer->lookahead)) {\n      lexer->advance(lexer, false);\n    }\n    return true;\n  } else if (lexer->lookahead == '+') {\n    lexer->result_symbol = PLUS;\n    lexer->advance(lexer, false);\n    return true;\n  } else if (lexer->lookahead == '-') {\n    lexer->result_symbol = MINUS;\n    lexer->advance(lexer, false);\n    return true;\n  } else if (lexer->lookahead == '*') {\n    lexer->result_symbol = TIMES;\n    lexer->advance(lexer, false);\n    return true;\n  } else if (lexer->lookahead == '/') {\n    lexer->result_symbol = DIVIDE;\n    lexer->advance(lexer, false);\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\nvoid *tree_sitter_arithmetic_create_parser() { return NULL; }\nvoid tree_sitter_arithmetic_destroy_parser(void *p) {}\nvoid tree_sitter_arithmetic_reset_parser(void *p) {}\n\nunsigned tree_sitter_arithmetic_parse(void *p, TSTree *tree, const char *input, uint32_t input_size) {\n  TSLexer lexer;\n  lexer.lookahead = 0;\n  lexer.result_symbol = 0;\n  lexer.advance = NULL;\n  lexer.mark_end = NULL;\n  lexer.get_column = NULL;\n  lexer.is_at_included_range_start = NULL;\n  lexer.eof = NULL;\n\n  TSTreeCursor cursor;\n  ts_tree_cursor_init(&cursor, tree, (const uint32_t *)input, input_size);\n\n  while (ts_tree_cursor_goto_next(&cursor)) {\n    TSTreeCursor child_cursor = cursor;\n    if (ts_tree_cursor_goto_first_child(&child_cursor)) {\n      do {\n        // Handle the child node\n      } while (ts_tree_cursor_goto_next_sibling(&child_cursor));\n      ts_tree_cursor_goto_parent(&child_cursor);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return 0;\n}\n\nTSLanguage *tree_sitter_arithmetic() {\n  static TSLanguage language = {\n      .version = 0,\n      .symbol_count = 6,\n      .alias_count = 0,\n      .token_count = 5,\n      .external_token_count = 0,\n      .state_count = 7,\n      .large_state_count = 0,\n      .production_id_count = 5,\n      .field_count = 0,\n      .max_alias_sequence_length = 0,\n      .parse_table = NULL,\n      .small_parse_table = NULL,\n      .small_parse_table_map = NULL,\n      .parse_actions = NULL,\n      .symbol_names = (const char *[]){\"NUMBER\", \"PLUS\", \"MINUS\", \"TIMES\", \"DIVIDE\", NULL},\n      .field_names = NULL,\n      .field_map_slices = NULL,\n      .field_map_entries = NULL,\n      .symbol_metadata = NULL,\n      .public_symbol_map = NULL,\n      .alias_map = NULL,\n      .alias_sequences = NULL,\n      .lex_modes = NULL,\n      .lex_fn = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_scan,\n      .keyword_lex_fn = NULL,\n      .keyword_capture_token = 0,\n      .external_scanner = {\n          .states = NULL,\n          .symbol_map = NULL,\n          .create = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_create,\n          .destroy = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_destroy,\n          .scan = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_scan,\n          .serialize = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_serialize,\n          .deserialize = tree_sitter_arithmetic_external_scanner_deserialize,\n      },\n      .primary_state_ids = NULL,\n  };\n  return &language;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a simple arithmetic language with four operators: +, -, *, and /. The `tree_sitter_arithmetic` function returns a `TSLanguage` struct that contains information about the language being parsed. The `tree_sitter_arithmetic_parse` function takes an input program and a `TSTree` struct and performs parsing of the input program using the Tree-sitter parser.

This scanner extends the functionality of the default scanner provided by the Tree-sitter library by recognizing certain types of tokens that are not handled by the default scanner.\n\nThe scanner defines four token types: `AUTOMATIC_SEMICOLON`, `TEMPLATE_CHARS`, and `TERNARY_QMARK`. These token types are used to recognize specific patterns in JavaScript code, such as automatically inserted semicolons, template literals, and ternary operators.\n\nThe scanner is implemented as a set of functions that are called by the main parser when it encounters a token that matches one of the defined types. These functions use the `TSLexer` interface provided by Tree-sitter to read and manipulate the input stream of characters.\n\nFor example, the `scan_template_chars` function scans the input stream for a template literal and returns true if one is found. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input stream and looking for the backtick character that marks the end of the literal. Along the way, it also recognizes the `${}` syntax used to embed expressions inside the literal.\n\n```c\nbool scan_template_chars(TSLexer *lexer) {\n  // ... (rest of the code)\n}\n```\n\nAnother example is the `scan_automatic_semicolon` function, which recognizes semicolons that are automatically inserted by the JavaScript interpreter. It does this by looking for certain patterns of characters that indicate the end of a statement.\n\n```c\nbool scan_automatic_semicolon(TSLexer *lexer) {\n  // ... (rest of the code)\n}\n```\n\nBy providing additional functionality to the main parser, this scanner allows the parser to more accurately parse JavaScript code and provide better error messages to the user.\n\nIn the `tree_sitter` subfolder, the `parser.h` file is a crucial component of the Tree-sitter parser, responsible for generating the parse table and performing parsing of input source code.

  "summary": "The `js-grammar` folder in the Weave project contains the core grammar and language bindings for parsing and analyzing JavaScript code using the Tree-sitter library. The main file, `grammar.js`, defines the grammar rules for the Weave language, which are used to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the source code. The grammar is organized into sections such as Export and Import declarations, Statements, Expressions, Primitives, and Expression components.\n\nFor example, given the following Weave code snippet:\n\n```weave\nimport { foo } from './module';\nexport const bar = foo + 1;\n```\n\nThe grammar would parse this code into an AST with nodes representing the import statement, export statement, and the various expressions and identifiers used in the code. This AST can then be used for further analysis, transformation, or code generation.\n\nThe `bindings` folder provides language bindings for different programming languages, such as Node.js and Rust, enabling the Tree-sitter parsing library to parse and analyze Weave source code. The Node.js bindings can be used as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst Parser = require(\"tree-sitter\");\nconst Weave = require(\"./weave\");\n\nconst parser = new Parser();\nparser.setLanguage(Weave);\n\nconst sourceCode = `\n  function add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst tree = parser.parse(sourceCode);\n\nconsole.log(tree.rootNode.toString());\n```\n\nThe Rust bindings can be used like this:\n\n```rust\nuse tree_sitter::Parser;\nuse tree_sitter_weave;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new();\n    parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language()).unwrap();\n    let code = \"some Weave code\";\n    let tree = parser.parse(code, None).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", tree.root_node());\n}\n```\n\nThe `src` folder contains the `scanner.c` file, which provides an external scanner for parsing and manipulating JavaScript code.
