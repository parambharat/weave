  "summary": "The code above defines a default language binding for the Weave project. A language binding is a set of functions that allow Weave to interact with a specific programming language. This default language binding is used when parsing is not supported, as it requires a Weave interface. \n\nThe `DefaultLanguageBinding` class implements the `LanguageBinding` interface, which requires three functions: `parse`, `printGraph`, and `printType`. The `parse` function is not implemented and throws an error if called. The `printGraph` function takes an `EditingNode` object and an optional `indent` parameter and returns a string representation of the node. The `printType` function takes a `Type` object and an optional `simple` parameter and returns a string representation of the type.\n\nThis default language binding is provided as a compatibility shim for existing use cases that depend on the `nodeToString` and `typeToString` functionality provided by the `StaticOpStore` class. The `StaticOpStore` class is imported from the `../opStore/static` module and represents the static state of Weave. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger Weave project to provide a default language binding for cases where parsing is not supported. For example, if a user wants to print a graph or type to a string representation, they can use the `printGraph` and `printType` functions provided by this default language binding. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { defaultLanguageBinding } from 'weave';\n\nconst node = { /* EditingNode object */ };\nconst type = { /* Type object */ };\n\nconst graphString = defaultLanguageBinding.printGraph(node);\nconst typeString = defaultLanguageBinding.printType(type);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LanguageBinding` interface and how is it used in this code?\n- The `LanguageBinding` interface defines methods for parsing and printing expressions and types. It is implemented by the `DefaultLanguageBinding` class to provide default functionality for printing expressions and types.\n\n2. Why is the `DefaultLanguageBinding` class provided as a compatibility shim?\n- The `DefaultLanguageBinding` class is provided as a compatibility shim for existing use cases that depend on the static `nodeToString` and `typeToString` functionality. It is technically incorrect to depend on this class because the static op store may not represent the true state of Weave.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `defaultLanguageBinding` export?\n- The `defaultLanguageBinding` export is an instance of the `DefaultLanguageBinding` class and provides default functionality for printing expressions and types. It can be used as a fallback option when a more specific language binding is not available."
