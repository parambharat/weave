      "summary": "This file contains several functions that generate URLs for different resources in the larger project. The `artifact` function generates a URL for a specific artifact in the project, based on the provided parameters. The `artifactCollection` function generates a URL for a collection of artifacts, based on the provided parameters. The `project` function generates a URL for a specific project, based on the provided parameters. The `run` function generates a URL for a specific run of a project, based on the provided parameters. Finally, the `reportView` function generates a URL for a specific report in the project, based on the provided parameters.\n\nEach function takes in an object with specific properties that are used to construct the URL. For example, the `artifact` function takes in an object with properties for the entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, and artifact commit hash. These properties are used to construct a URL in the format `/{entityName}/{projectName}/artifacts/{artifactTypeName}/{artifactSequenceName}/{artifactCommitHash}`.\n\nThe `makeNameAndID` function is also included in this file, which is used by the `reportView` function to generate a name and ID for a report. This function takes in an ID and an optional name, and returns a string that combines the two in the format `{encodeURIComponent(name)}--{id}`. The `encodeURIComponent` function is used to ensure that the name is properly encoded for use in a URL.\n\nOverall, these functions are used to generate URLs for different resources in the project, which can be used to access those resources via HTTP requests. For example, the `artifact` function could be used to generate a URL for a specific artifact, which could then be used to download or view that artifact. The `project` function could be used to generate a URL for a specific project, which could then be used to view information about that project. These functions provide a convenient way to generate URLs for different resources in the project, without having to manually construct them each time.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code provides functions for generating URLs for various artifacts, runs, and reports within the `weave` project, but it does not provide information on the overall purpose of the project.\n\n2. What are the expected inputs for the functions in this code?\n- The functions take in different combinations of entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, artifact commit hash, artifact collection name, run name, report ID, and report name as string inputs.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `makeNameAndID` function and how is it used?\n- The `makeNameAndID` function takes in an ID and an optional name, and returns a string that combines the name and ID in a URL-friendly format. It is used in the `reportView` function to generate a URL for a report with a given ID and name."

      "summary": "The code above defines several interfaces that are used to represent GraphQL queries in the weave project. \n\nThe `QueryArg` interface represents a single argument in a GraphQL query. It has two properties: `name`, which is a string representing the name of the argument, and `value`, which can be any type of value. \n\nThe `QueryField` interface represents a single field in a GraphQL query. It has four properties: `name`, which is a string representing the name of the field, `args`, which is an optional array of `QueryArg` objects representing the arguments for the field, `fields`, which is an array of `QueryField` objects representing the subfields of the field, and `alias`, which is an optional string representing the alias for the field. \n\nThe `Query` interface represents a complete GraphQL query. It has a single property: `queryFields`, which is an array of `QueryField` objects representing the top-level fields of the query. \n\nThese interfaces are used throughout the weave project to define and manipulate GraphQL queries. For example, a function that builds a GraphQL query might use these interfaces to construct the query object. Here's an example of how this might look:\n\n```\nimport { Query, QueryField, QueryArg } from 'weave';\n\nfunction buildQuery(): Query {\n  const queryFields: QueryField[] = [\n    {\n      name: 'user',\n      args: [\n        { name: 'id', value: 123 },\n      ],\n      fields: [\n        { name: 'name' },\n        { name: 'email' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return { queryFields };\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `buildQuery` function constructs a `Query` object with a single top-level field: a `user` field with an `id` argument and two subfields (`name` and `email`). This query could then be executed against a GraphQL API using a library like Apollo Client.",
      "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `QueryArg` interface?** \nThe `QueryArg` interface defines the structure of an argument that can be passed to a query field, including its name and value.\n\n2. **What is the significance of the `args` property in the `QueryField` interface?** \nThe `args` property is an optional array of `QueryArg` objects that can be used to pass arguments to the query field.\n\n3. **What is the overall purpose of the `Query` interface?** \nThe `Query` interface defines the structure of a GraphQL query, including an array of `QueryField` objects that represent the fields to be queried."

  "summary": "The code in the `urls.ts` file provides utility functions to generate URLs for various resources within the larger project. These functions accept specific parameters and return a URL string that can be used to access the corresponding resource via HTTP requests. For example, the `artifact` function generates a URL for a specific artifact, given its entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, and artifact commit hash.\n\nHere's an example of how the `artifact` function might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { artifact } from './urls';\n\nconst url = artifact({\n  entityName: 'exampleEntity',\n  projectName: 'exampleProject',\n  artifactTypeName: 'exampleType',\n  artifactSequenceName: 'exampleSequence',\n  artifactCommitHash: 'exampleHash',\n});\n\nconsole.log(url); // Output: /exampleEntity/exampleProject/artifacts/exampleType/exampleSequence/exampleHash\n```\n\nThe `vega3.ts` file defines interfaces for representing GraphQL queries in the project. These interfaces (`QueryArg`, `QueryField`, and `Query`) are used to define and manipulate GraphQL queries throughout the project. For instance, a function that builds a GraphQL query might use these interfaces to construct the query object.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Query` interface might be used to build a GraphQL query:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Query, QueryField, QueryArg } from './vega3';\n\nfunction buildQuery(): Query {\n  const queryFields: QueryField[] = [\n    {\n      name: 'user',\n      args: [\n        { name: 'id', value: 123 },\n      ],\n      fields: [\n        { name: 'name' },\n        { name: 'email' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return { queryFields };\n}\n\nconst query = buildQuery();\n```\n\nIn this example, the `buildQuery` function constructs a `Query` object with a single top-level field: a `user` field with an `id` argument and two subfields (`name` and `email`).

These utilities and interfaces are used throughout the project to facilitate the construction and manipulation of URLs and GraphQL queries, making it easier for developers to work with these resources.",
