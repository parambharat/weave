  "summary": "The code in this file provides stubbable server APIs for the larger project called weave. The purpose of this code is to allow compute graph functions to take context as their first argument and use methods provided in that context to make API calls. The code also provides two interfaces: FreshContext and ResolverContext.\n\nThe FreshContext interface has two properties: backend and frame. The backend property is of type ServerAPI and represents the server API that the context will use to make API calls. The frame property is of type Frame and represents the frame that the context will use.\n\nThe ResolverContext interface extends the FreshContext interface and adds a trace property of type Tracer. This property represents the tracer that the context will use.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide a way for compute graph functions to make API calls using a context that is globally set. This can be useful for testing purposes, as it allows developers to stub out the server API and provide their own implementation for testing.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```typescript\nimport { useContextBound } from 'cgreact';\nimport { FreshContext } from 'weave';\n\nfunction myFunction(context: FreshContext) {\n  // Use the context to make API calls\n}\n\n// Use the useContextBound hook to get a version of myFunction\n// that has the context populated by whatever is globally set.\nconst myFunctionWithContext = useContextBound(myFunction);\n\n// Call myFunctionWithContext with a context that has a stubbed out server API\nconst context = {\n  backend: {\n    // Implement your own server API methods here for testing purposes\n  },\n  frame: {\n    // Set up your own frame here for testing purposes\n  }\n};\nmyFunctionWithContext(context);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file in the `weave` project?\n- This file provides stubbable server APIs for the project.\n\n2. What is the difference between `FreshContext` and `ResolverContext`?\n- `FreshContext` includes `backend` and `frame` properties, while `ResolverContext` includes those properties as well as a `trace` property of type `Tracer`.\n\n3. What is the `useContextBound` hook mentioned in the code comments?\n- The `useContextBound` hook is used in `cgreact` to create versions of compute graph functions that have the context populated by a global setting."
