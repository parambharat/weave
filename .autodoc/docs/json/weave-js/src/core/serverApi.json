  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `ServerAPI` that specifies methods for interacting with a server. The interface includes methods for executing a Vega3 query, resetting the execution cache, and retrieving file contents and metadata for artifacts and run files.\n\nThe `execute` method takes a Vega3 query as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the query result. This method can be used to execute Vega3 queries on the server.\n\nThe `resetExecutionCache` method resets the execution cache on the server. This method can be used to clear the cache and start fresh.\n\nThe `getArtifactFileContents` method retrieves the contents of a file in an artifact. It takes an artifact ID and an asset path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the file contents. This method can be used to retrieve files from artifacts stored on the server.\n\nThe `getArtifactFileDirectUrl` method retrieves the direct URL of a file in an artifact. It takes an artifact ID and an asset path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the file URL. This method can be used to retrieve the URL of files stored in artifacts on the server.\n\nThe `getArtifactFileMetadata` method retrieves the metadata of a file or directory in an artifact. It takes an artifact ID and an asset path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the metadata. This method can be used to retrieve metadata for files and directories stored in artifacts on the server.\n\nThe `getRunFileContents` method retrieves the contents of a file in a run. It takes a project name, run name, and file name as input, and an optional entity name, and returns a Promise that resolves to the file contents. This method can be used to retrieve files from runs stored on the server.\n\nOverall, this interface provides a set of methods for interacting with a server that stores artifacts and run files. These methods can be used to retrieve file contents and metadata, execute Vega3 queries, and reset the execution cache.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Vega3` import?\n- The `Vega3` import is used in the `execute` method of the `ServerAPI` interface, suggesting that it is related to executing queries.\n\n2. What types of files can be retrieved using the `getArtifactFileMetadata` method?\n- The `getArtifactFileMetadata` method can retrieve metadata for directories, files, or return null if the asset path is invalid.\n\n3. What is the expected return type of the `getRunFileContents` method?\n- The `getRunFileContents` method is expected to return a `Promise` containing the contents of a run file."
