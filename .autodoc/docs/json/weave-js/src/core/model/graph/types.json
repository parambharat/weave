  "summary": "This file contains various interfaces and types used in the Weave project, which is a data visualization platform. The interfaces and types defined in this file are used to represent nodes and operations in the Weave dataflow graph. \n\nThe `BaseNode` interface defines a type property that is used to specify the type of a node. The `OutputNode` interface extends `BaseNode` and adds a `nodeType` property that is always set to `'output'`. The `VarNode` interface extends `BaseNode` and adds a `nodeType` property that is always set to `'var'`. The `ConstNode` interface extends `BaseNode` and adds a `nodeType` property that is always set to `'const'`. The `Node` type is a union of `OutputNode`, `VarNode`, and `ConstNode`. The `VoidNode` interface extends `BaseNode` and is used to represent a node that represents nothing. \n\nThe `Op` interface defines an operation that can be performed on input nodes. It has a `name` property that specifies the name of the operation and an `inputs` property that is an object that maps input names to input nodes. The `OpFn` type is a function that takes an `OpInputNodes` object and returns an `OutputNode`. The `OpInputNodes` type is an object that maps input names to input nodes. The `OpResolverInputTypes` type is an object that maps input names to input types. The `TypeFn` type is a function that takes an `OpInputNodes` object and returns a type. The `ReturnTypeFn` type is a function that takes an `OpInputNodes` object and returns a type. The `InputTypes` type is an object that maps input names to input types. The `OutputTypeAsNode` type is a `ConstNode` that represents the output type of an operation. The `OutputTypeGeneric` type is a union of a type, a `TypeFn`, and an `OutputTypeAsNode`. The `OutputType` type is a `OutputTypeGeneric` with `InputTypes` and `Type` as its generic parameters. \n\nThe `OpRenderInfo` type is used to specify how an operation is represented visually. It can be a function call, a chain, a get attribute, brackets, a dictionary literal, an array literal, binary, or boolean combination. The `OpCachePolicy` interface is used to define the cacheability of an operation result. It has a `ttlSeconds` property that specifies the time-to-live of the cache in seconds. The `SupportedEnginesType` type is a set of strings that specifies the supported engines for an operation. \n\nThe `OpDefBase` interface defines an operation that can be executed. It has a `name` property that specifies the name of the operation, an `inputTypes` property that maps input names to input types, an `outputType` property that specifies the output type of the operation, a `renderInfo` property that specifies how the operation is represented visually, a `hidden` property that specifies whether the operation is available to users, a `kind` property that is used for internal understanding of operations, a `cachePolicy` property that specifies the cacheability of the operation result, a `description` property that is a user-facing description of the operation, an `argDescriptions` property that maps argument names to their descriptions in markdown, a `returnValueDescription` property that is a description of the output in markdown, and a `supportedEngines` property that specifies the supported engines for the operation. \n\nThe other types and interfaces defined in this file are used to represent various data types used in the Weave project, such as media types, input types, and output types.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Op` interface and its related types?\n- The `Op` interface and its related types are used to represent available ops, their resolvers, and other information needed to execute them. They define the argument specification, return type, visual representation, cache policy, and other metadata for each op.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `TypeToTSTypeInner` type?\n- The `TypeToTSTypeInner` type is used to convert a `Type` from the project's runtime type system to an actual TypeScript type that matches it. It handles various built-in types like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`, as well as custom types like `ImageType` and `TableType`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Closure` interface and its related types?\n- The `Closure` interface and its related types are used to represent a closure, which is a function object that has captured its own stack of variable bindings. They define the stack of variable bindings and the value of the closure expression."
