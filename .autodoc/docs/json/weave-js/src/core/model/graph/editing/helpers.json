  "summary": "The `nodesEqual` function in the `weave` project is used to compare two `EditingNode` objects and determine if they are equal. The function takes two arguments, `node1` and `node2`, both of which are of type `EditingNode`. The function first checks if both nodes are of type `void` and returns `true` if they are. If the nodes are not of type `void`, the function checks if their `type` properties are equal using the `_.isEqual` method from the `lodash` library. If the `type` properties are not equal, the function returns `false`.\n\nIf the `type` properties are equal, the function checks the `nodeType` property of each node. If both nodes are of type `const`, the function checks if their `val` properties are equal. If both nodes are of type `var`, the function checks if their `varName` properties are equal. If both nodes are of type `output`, the function checks if their `fromOp` properties are equal. If the `name` property of the `fromOp` objects are not equal, the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the function checks if all the keys in the `inputs` property of both `fromOp` objects are equal and if their values are equal.\n\nThe `nodesEqual` function can be used in the larger `weave` project to compare two `EditingNode` objects and determine if they are equal. This can be useful in various parts of the project where `EditingNode` objects are used, such as in the creation and manipulation of data flow graphs. For example, if a user makes changes to a data flow graph, the `nodesEqual` function can be used to check if the graph has been modified and needs to be updated. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { nodesEqual } from 'weave';\n\nconst node1 = {\n  nodeType: 'const',\n  type: 'number',\n  val: 10\n};\n\nconst node2 = {\n  nodeType: 'const',\n  type: 'number',\n  val: 5\n};\n\nconst equal = nodesEqual(node1, node2); // false\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `nodesEqual` function?\n- The `nodesEqual` function is used to compare two `EditingNode` objects and determine if they are equal.\n\n2. What is the role of the `Editing` module?\n- The `Editing` module contains type definitions for `EditingNode` and other related types used in the `nodesEqual` function.\n\n3. Why is the `lodash` library imported?\n- The `lodash` library is imported to use the `isEqual` function, which is used to compare the `type` property of the two `EditingNode` objects in the `nodesEqual` function."
