  "summary": "This file contains TypeScript interfaces for defining the structure of data objects used in the larger project called weave. Specifically, it defines two interfaces: `WBImage` and `ClassSet`. \n\nThe `WBImage` interface defines the structure of an image file object. It has properties such as `type`, `digest`, `path`, `width`, and `height`. The `type` property is always set to `'image-file'` to indicate that this is an image file object. The `digest` property is a unique identifier for the image file. The `path` property is the file path to the image file. The `width` and `height` properties are the dimensions of the image. \n\nAdditionally, the `WBImage` interface has optional properties for bounding boxes and masks. The `boxes` property is an object that contains an array of bounding boxes for each box group. The `masks` property is an object that contains a mask file for each mask name. \n\nThe `ClassSet` interface defines the structure of a class set object. It has a `type` property set to `'class-set'` to indicate that this is a class set object. The `class_set` property is an array of objects that contain information about each class in the set. Each object has a `name`, `id`, and `color` property. \n\nThese interfaces are used throughout the larger project to ensure that data objects are structured consistently and can be easily passed between different parts of the project. For example, the `WBImage` interface may be used to represent an image file that is loaded into the project, while the `ClassSet` interface may be used to represent the set of classes that can be applied to objects in the image. \n\nHere is an example of how the `WBImage` interface may be used in code:\n\n```\nconst image: WBImage = {\n  type: 'image-file',\n  digest: 'abc123',\n  path: '/path/to/image.jpg',\n  width: 800,\n  height: 600,\n  boxes: {\n    'group1': [\n      { x: 100, y: 100, width: 200, height: 200 },\n      { x: 400, y: 300, width: 100, height: 100 }\n    ],\n    'group2': [\n      { x: 200, y: 200, width: 300, height: 300 }\n    ]\n  },\n  masks: {\n    'mask1': {\n      type: 'mask-file',\n      digest: 'def456',\n      path: '/path/to/mask1.png'\n    },\n    'mask2': {\n      type: 'mask-file',\n      digest: 'ghi789',\n      path: '/path/to/mask2.png'\n    }\n  },\n  classes: {\n    type: 'classes-file',\n    digest: 'jkl012',\n    path: '/path/to/classes.json'\n  }\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the BoundingBox2D type from the '../../_external/types/media' module?\n- A smart developer might ask what the BoundingBox2D type is used for and how it is defined in the media module. \n\n2. What is the difference between a MaskFile and a ClassesFile in the WBImage interface?\n- A smart developer might ask for clarification on the distinction between a MaskFile and a ClassesFile in the WBImage interface and how they are used in the project.\n\n3. How is the ClassSet type used in the project?\n- A smart developer might ask how the ClassSet type is used in the project and what its purpose is in relation to the other interfaces and modules."
