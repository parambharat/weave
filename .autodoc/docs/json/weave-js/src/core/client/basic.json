  "summary": "The `BasicClient` class is a client-side implementation of a GraphQL client that communicates with a server to retrieve data. It provides methods for subscribing to and querying data from the server, as well as controlling polling behavior and refreshing data.\n\nThe class imports several dependencies, including `Observable` from the `zen-observable` library, various types and classes from other files in the project, and the `lodash` library.\n\nThe class implements the `Client` interface, which defines the methods that a client must provide. The `BasicClient` class has several private properties, including an `opStore` object, a map of `ObservableNode` objects that represent data nodes, a `loading` observable that tracks whether data is currently being loaded, and several other properties related to polling and refreshing data.\n\nThe class provides several public methods, including `subscribe`, which subscribes to a data node and returns an `Observable` that emits data when it changes; `query`, which queries a data node and returns a `Promise` that resolves with the data; `action`, which queries a data node and returns a `Promise` that resolves with the result of the query; `loadingObservable`, which returns the `loading` observable; `refreshAll`, which refreshes all data nodes and returns a `Promise` that resolves when the refresh is complete; and several methods related to polling behavior.\n\nThe class also has several private methods, including `scheduleRequest`, which schedules a request to the server to retrieve data; `pollIteration`, which refreshes all data nodes at a regular interval if polling is enabled; `setIsLoading`, which sets the `loading` observable to indicate whether data is currently being loaded; `requestBatch`, which retrieves data from the server for all data nodes that have not yet been loaded; `doRequestBatch`, which actually retrieves the data from the server and updates the `ObservableNode` objects with the new data; and `executeForwardListeners`, which executes forward listeners on the server to retrieve data.\n\nOverall, the `BasicClient` class provides a way to subscribe to and query data from a server, as well as control polling behavior and refresh data. It is a key component of the larger project and is used extensively throughout the codebase.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ObservableNode` interface and how is it used in the code?\n   \n   The `ObservableNode` interface defines an object that contains an `id`, an `observable`, a `node`, a set of `observers`, a `hasResult` boolean, and a `lastResult`. It is used to keep track of observables and their associated nodes, observers, and results in the `BasicClient` class.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `loading` property and how is it used in the code?\n   \n   The `loading` property is an `Observable` that emits a boolean value indicating whether the client is currently loading data. It is used to notify subscribers when the client is loading data, and is updated by the `setIsLoading` method.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `pollIteration` method and how is it used in the code?\n   \n   The `pollIteration` method is used to periodically refresh all observables in the client when polling is enabled. It is called by the constructor of the `BasicClient` class and sets a timeout to call itself again after a fixed interval."
