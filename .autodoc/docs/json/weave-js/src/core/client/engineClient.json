  "summary": "The `EngineClient` class provides a client interface on top of the `Engine` class for certain operations, such as `partitionedTableRows`, that use a shared function between the `refineNode` and `resolver` implementations. \n\nThe `EngineClient` class implements the `Client` interface, which defines methods for subscribing to nodes, querying nodes, and performing actions on nodes. The `subscribe` method returns an `Observable` that can be used to listen for changes to a node. The `query` method executes a node and returns the result. The `action` method performs an action on a node. \n\nThe `EngineClient` class also provides methods for managing polling. The `setPolling` method sets the polling state, while the `setIsPolling` method sets the isPolling state. The `isPolling` method returns the current polling state. The `addOnPollingChangeListener` and `removeOnPollingChangeListener` methods add and remove listeners for changes to the polling state. \n\nThe `debugMeta` method returns an object with debug information about the `EngineClient` instance, including the `id` and debug information about the `OpStore`. \n\nThis class is likely used in the larger project to provide a simplified interface for certain operations that use a shared function between the `refineNode` and `resolver` implementations. It may also be used to manage polling for nodes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport {EngineClient} from 'weave';\n\nconst engineClient = new EngineClient(engine);\n\nconst node = // create a node\n\nengineClient.query(node).then(result => {\n  // handle result\n});\n\nconst subscription = engineClient.subscribe(node).subscribe(value => {\n  // handle value\n});\n\nengineClient.setPolling(true);\n\nengineClient.debugMeta(); // returns debug information\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EngineClient` class?\n- The `EngineClient` class provides a client interface on top of the engine and is used for certain operations that use a shared function between the refineNode and resolver implementations.\n\n2. What methods are currently not implemented in the `EngineClient` class?\n- The `subscribe`, `loadingObservable`, `refreshAll`, and `action` methods are currently not implemented in the `EngineClient` class.\n\n3. What is the return type of the `query` method in the `EngineClient` class?\n- The `query` method in the `EngineClient` class returns a Promise that resolves to any type."
