  "summary": "The code in this file defines two functions, `standardOpType` and `standardOpValue`, that are used to apply a given function to a `Type` or a value of any type, respectively. These functions are part of the larger `weave` project and are likely used to manipulate data in some way.\n\nThe `standardOpType` function takes two arguments: a `Type` and a function that takes a `Type` as input and returns a `Type`. It then returns the result of calling the `mappableNullableTaggable` function with these arguments. The `mappableNullableTaggable` function is imported from another file in the `weave` project and is likely used to apply a given function to a `Type` in a way that preserves its mappable and nullable properties.\n\nHere is an example of how `standardOpType` might be used:\n\n```\nimport { standardOpType } from 'weave';\n\nconst myType = { name: 'string', nullable: true, mappable: true };\nconst applyFn = (inType) => ({ ...inType, name: 'number' });\n\nconst newType = standardOpType(myType, applyFn);\n// newType is now { name: 'number', nullable: true, mappable: true }\n```\n\nThe `standardOpValue` function is similar to `standardOpType`, but takes a value of any type as its first argument and a function that takes a value of that type as input and returns a value of the same type. It then returns the result of calling the `mappableNullableTaggableVal` function with these arguments. This function is likely used to apply a given function to a value in a way that preserves its mappable and nullable properties.\n\nHere is an example of how `standardOpValue` might be used:\n\n```\nimport { standardOpValue } from 'weave';\n\nconst myValue = 'hello';\nconst applyFn = (inVal) => inVal.toUpperCase();\n\nconst newValue = standardOpValue(myValue, applyFn);\n// newValue is now 'HELLO'\n```\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way to apply a given function to a `Type` or a value of any type in a way that preserves certain properties. They are likely used in the larger `weave` project to manipulate data in a consistent and predictable way.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `standardOpType` function?\n   - The `standardOpType` function takes in a `Type` and an `applyFn` function and returns a mappable, nullable, and taggable version of the `Type` with the `applyFn` applied to it.\n2. What is the purpose of the `standardOpValue` function?\n   - The `standardOpValue` function takes in a value and an `applyFn` function and returns a mappable, nullable, and taggable version of the value with the `applyFn` applied to it.\n3. What is the significance of the `mappableNullableTaggable` and `mappableNullableTaggableVal` functions?\n   - The `mappableNullableTaggable` and `mappableNullableTaggableVal` functions are imported from the `model` module and are used to create mappable, nullable, and taggable versions of a `Type` or a value. These functions likely have important use cases within the `weave` project."
