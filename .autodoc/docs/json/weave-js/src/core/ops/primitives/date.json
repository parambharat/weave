  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a module that provides a set of operations for working with dates. The code in this file defines several operations that can be used to manipulate and compare dates. \n\nThe `moment` library is imported to handle date manipulation. The `list` and `docType` functions are imported from other modules to define the types of arguments and return values for the operations. The `makeBasicDimDownOp` and `makeStandardOp` functions are imported from another module to create the operations.\n\nThe `opDateSub` operation takes two lists of dates as arguments and returns the difference between each pair of dates in milliseconds. The `opDateToNumber` operation takes a single date as an argument and returns the number of milliseconds since the epoch. The `opDatesMin` operation takes a list of dates as an argument and returns the earliest date in the list. The `opDatesEqual` operation takes two dates as arguments and returns whether they are equal.\n\nThe file also defines several operations for rounding dates to different levels of precision. These operations are not yet ready for production use and are hidden from the user interface. \n\nOverall, this module provides a set of basic operations for working with dates that can be used in other parts of the `weave` project. For example, these operations could be used to filter data by date or to calculate the time between two events. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {opDateSub, opDatesMin} from 'weave/date';\n\nconst dates1 = [new Date('2022-01-01'), new Date('2022-01-02'), new Date('2022-01-03')];\nconst dates2 = [new Date('2022-01-01'), new Date('2022-01-01'), new Date('2022-01-01')];\n\nconst diff = opDateSub.resolver({lhs: dates1, rhs: dates2}); // [0, 86400000, 172800000]\nconst earliestDate = opDatesMin.resolver({dates: dates1}); // new Date('2022-01-01')\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- Unfortunately, the code provided does not give any indication of the purpose of the `weave` project. \n\n2. What is the `makeStandardOp` function and how is it used?\n- The `makeStandardOp` function is imported from the `opKinds` module and is used to create a standard operation object. It is used to create the `opDateSub`, `opDateToNumber`, and `opDatesEqual` operations.\n\n3. Why are some of the operations marked as hidden and not yet ready for production?\n- Some of the operations, such as the date round operations, are marked as hidden and not yet ready for production because they are not fully developed and tested. They also need to handle tags and nulls, and there is still work to be done to figure out what kind of unit/type to return."
