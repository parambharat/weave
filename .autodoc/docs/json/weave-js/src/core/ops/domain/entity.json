  "summary": "The `weave` project contains a module that exports several functions related to entities. The purpose of this module is to provide a set of operations that can be performed on entities, such as retrieving their name, internal ID, link, and associated projects and artifact portfolios. \n\nThe module imports several helper functions and constants from other modules in the project, including `list` and `maybe` from `../../model/helpers`, `docType` from `../../util/docs`, and `makeTaggingStandardOp` from `../opKinds`. It also imports `connectionToNodes` from a local `util` module.\n\nThe module defines several constants that are functions created using `makeTaggingStandardOp`. These functions take an `entity` object as an argument and return a specific property of that entity. For example, `opEntityName` returns the name of the entity, while `opEntityInternalId` returns the internal ID of the entity. Each function has a name, a set of argument types, a description, and a resolver function that extracts the relevant property from the `entity` object.\n\nThe module also defines several constants that describe the argument types and descriptions used by the functions. For example, `entityArgTypes` is an object that defines a single property, `entity`, with a value of `'entity' as const`. This is used to specify the type of the `entity` argument in the function definitions. Similarly, `entityArgDescription` is a string that describes the `entity` argument as \"A(n) entity\".\n\nOverall, this module provides a set of operations that can be used to extract specific properties from entity objects. These operations can be used by other modules in the `weave` project to perform various tasks related to entities, such as generating links or displaying information about associated projects and artifact portfolios. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { opEntityName } from 'weave/entity';\n\nconst entity = { id: '123', name: 'My Entity' };\nconst name = opEntityName.resolver({ entity }); // returns 'My Entity'\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `makeTaggingStandardOp` function?\n- `makeTaggingStandardOp` is a function that creates standardized operations for tagging entities with metadata.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `opEntityArtifactPortfolios` function?\n- `opEntityArtifactPortfolios` is a function that returns the artifact portfolios of an entity.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `hidden` property in some of the functions?\n- The `hidden` property is used to hide certain functions from the user interface, likely because they are not intended to be used directly by users."
