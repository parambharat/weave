  "summary": "This file contains several functions and two exported objects that are used to generate standard operations for the `weave` project. The functions are used to extract information from a `SpanType` object, which is a data structure used to represent a trace of a request through a distributed system. The `getFirstError` function recursively searches through the `SpanType` object and returns the first error message it finds. The `getSpanRepr` function recursively generates a string representation of the `SpanType` object, including the names of all child spans. The `getSpanInputAsMarkdownString` and `getSpanOutputAsMarkdownString` functions generate markdown-formatted strings representing the inputs and outputs of the `SpanType` object, respectively.\n\nThe two exported objects are `opWBTraceTreeStartTime` and `opWBTraceTreeSummary`. These objects are generated using the `makeTaggingStandardOp` function from the `opKinds` module. They are used to define standard operations for the `weave` project. `opWBTraceTreeStartTime` extracts the start time of a trace from a `wb_trace_tree` object and returns it as a number. `opWBTraceTreeSummary` extracts various pieces of information from a `wb_trace_tree` object and returns them as a dictionary with keys such as `isSuccess`, `startTime`, `formattedInput`, `formattedOutput`, `formattedChain`, `error`, and `modelHash`. These keys correspond to various pieces of information about the trace, such as whether it was successful, when it started, what the inputs and outputs were, and whether there were any errors.\n\nOverall, this file provides functions and objects that are used to extract information from `SpanType` objects and define standard operations for the `weave` project. These functions and objects are likely used in other parts of the project to generate reports and analyze traces. For example, the `opWBTraceTreeSummary` object could be used to generate a summary of a trace that includes information about its inputs, outputs, and errors.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- As a code documentation expert, I cannot answer this question based on the given code alone. More information about the project is needed.\n\n2. What is the `SpanType` object and how is it used in this code?\n- The `SpanType` object is imported from `../../model/media/traceTree` and is used as a parameter in several functions to extract information from it, such as `status_code`, `status_message`, `name`, `span_kind`, `child_spans`, `results`, `inputs`, `outputs`, and `start_time_ms`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `opWBTraceTreeStartTime` and `opWBTraceTreeSummary` functions?\n- The `opWBTraceTreeStartTime` function is a standard operation that takes a `wb_trace_tree` argument and returns the start time of the root span in milliseconds. \n- The `opWBTraceTreeSummary` function is another standard operation that takes a `wb_trace_tree` argument and returns a dictionary containing information about the trace, such as whether it was successful, start time, formatted input/output/chain, error message, and model hash."
