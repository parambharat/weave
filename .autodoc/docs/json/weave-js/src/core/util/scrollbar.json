  "summary": "The code above is a custom React hook that provides functionality for showing and hiding a scrollbar based on user interaction. The hook returns an object with three properties: `visible`, `onScroll`, and `onMouseMove`. \n\nThe `visible` property is a boolean that indicates whether the scrollbar should be visible or not. The `onScroll` property is a function that sets the `visible` property to `true` when called. The `onMouseMove` property is a function that takes a `MouseEvent` object as an argument and checks if the mouse is outside the container element. If the mouse is outside the container element, the `makeScrollbarVisible` function is called, which sets the `visible` property to `true`. \n\nThe `makeScrollbarVisible` function is a memoized function that uses the `throttle` method from the Lodash library to limit the number of times it can be called within a certain time frame. When called, it sets the `visible` property to `true` and sets a timeout to hide the scrollbar after 2 seconds. If the function is called again before the timeout is complete, the previous timeout is cleared and a new one is set. \n\nThis hook can be used in a larger project to provide a more user-friendly interface for scrolling through content. By showing the scrollbar only when necessary, the interface can be less cluttered and more visually appealing. The hook can be used in conjunction with other React components to create a custom scrolling experience that meets the needs of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useScrollbarVisibility } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { visible, onScroll, onMouseMove } = useScrollbarVisibility();\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{ overflowY: 'scroll' }}\n      onScroll={onScroll}\n      onMouseMove={onMouseMove}\n    >\n      {visible && <div style={{ height: '20px' }} />}\n      <div style={{ height: '1000px' }}>Content goes here</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the `weave` project?\n   - This code exports a custom hook called `useScrollbarVisibility` that returns an object with properties related to scrollbar visibility. It is likely used in components that require scrollbar visibility functionality.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?\n   - The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a throttled function that sets the `resultsScrollbarVisible` state to `true` and schedules a timeout to set it back to `false` after 2 seconds. This is used to show and hide the scrollbar based on user interaction.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `handleMouseMove` function and how is it used?\n   - The `handleMouseMove` function is a callback function that is called when the user moves the mouse over a container element. It checks if the mouse is outside the container and calls the `makeScrollbarVisible` function to show the scrollbar. This function is passed as a prop to the container element to handle mouse move events."
