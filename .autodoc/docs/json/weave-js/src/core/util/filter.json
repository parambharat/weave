  "summary": "The `filterNodes` function in the `weave` project takes in an `EditingNode` object, a filter function, and an optional boolean flag. It returns an array of `EditingNode` objects that pass the filter function.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to traverse a graph of `EditingNode` objects and filter out nodes that do not meet a certain criteria. The `EditingNode` object represents a node in the graph and contains information about its type, value, and connections to other nodes.\n\nThe `filterFn` parameter is a function that takes in an `EditingNode` object and returns a boolean value. This function is used to determine whether a node should be included in the final result. If the function returns `true` for a given node, that node is added to the result array.\n\nThe `excludeFnBodies` parameter is an optional boolean flag that is used to exclude function bodies from the search. If this flag is set to `true`, the function will not search inside function bodies for additional nodes to include in the result.\n\nThe function first checks if the filter function returns `true` for the initial `node` parameter. If it does, the node is added to the result array. If the node is a constant with a function type and the `excludeFnBodies` flag is not set, the function recursively calls itself on the `val` property of the node. This is done to search for additional nodes inside the function body that may meet the filter criteria.\n\nIf the node is an output node, the function searches through its child nodes by iterating over the `inputs` property of the `fromOp` object and calling `filterNodes` on each input node. The resulting array of child nodes is concatenated with the current result array.\n\nOverall, this function is a useful tool for filtering out nodes in a graph based on a given criteria. It can be used in the larger project to perform various operations on the graph, such as finding all nodes of a certain type or filtering out nodes that are not relevant to a particular task. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst nodes = [node1, node2, node3, node4];\nconst filteredNodes = filterNodes(node1, (node) => node.nodeType === 'const');\nconsole.log(filteredNodes); // [node1, node3]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `filterNodes` function?\n- The `filterNodes` function takes in an `EditingNode`, a filtering function, and an optional boolean flag, and returns an array of `EditingNode`s that pass the filtering function. \n\n2. What is the significance of the `excludeFnBodies` parameter?\n- The `excludeFnBodies` parameter is an optional boolean flag that determines whether or not to exclude function bodies when filtering nodes. If it is set to `true`, then function bodies will be excluded from the filtering process. \n\n3. What types of nodes are included in the resulting array?\n- The resulting array includes `EditingNode`s that pass the filtering function, as well as any child nodes of `const` nodes that are functions (if `excludeFnBodies` is not set to `true`) and any child nodes of `output` nodes."
