  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a file with various utility functions. These functions can be used throughout the project to perform common tasks. \n\nThe `notEmpty` function is a type predicate that checks if a value is not null or undefined. This function is especially useful when filtering arrays, as it can be used to filter out null or undefined values. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr = ['a', null, 'b'];\nconst filteredArr = arr.filter(notEmpty);\n// filteredArr is ['a', 'b']\n```\n\nThe `notArray` function is another type predicate that checks if a value is not an array. This can be useful when working with functions that expect a non-array value. \n\nThe `isObject` function checks if a value is an object. This function uses the `isObject` method from the Lodash library to perform the check. \n\nThe `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function recursively maps over an object or array and applies a function to each value. If the value is an array, the function is applied to each item in the array. If the value is an object, the function is applied to each value in the object. For example:\n\n```\nconst obj = {\n  a: [1, 2, 3],\n  b: {\n    c: 4,\n    d: [5, 6, 7]\n  }\n};\n\nconst mappedObj = deepMapValuesAndArrays(obj, (val) => val * 2);\n// mappedObj is {\n//   a: [2, 4, 6],\n//   b: {\n//     c: 8,\n//     d: [10, 12, 14]\n//   }\n// }\n```\n\nThe `zip` function takes multiple arrays and returns an array of objects where each key is the index of the input arrays and each value is the corresponding value at that index. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nconst arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nconst zippedArr = zip(arr1, arr2);\n// zippedArr is [\n//   {0: 1, 1: 'a'},\n//   {0: 2, 1: 'b'},\n//   {0: 3, 1: 'c'}\n// ]\n```\n\nThe `shallowEqual` function checks if two objects are equal by comparing their keys and values. This function only performs a shallow comparison, meaning it does not compare nested objects or arrays. \n\nThe `toIncludesObj` function takes an array of strings and returns an object where each key is a string from the input array and each value is `true`. This function can be useful when checking if a string is included in a list of strings. For example:\n\n```\nconst list = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nconst includesObj = toIncludesObj(list);\n// includesObj is {a: true, b: true, c: true}\n\nconst str = 'b';\nif (includesObj[str]) {\n  console.log(`${str} is included in the list`);\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `notEmpty` and `notArray` functions?\n- The `notEmpty` function checks if a value is not null or undefined, and returns a type predicate. The `notArray` function checks if a value is not an array, and returns a type predicate.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function?\n- The `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function recursively maps over an object or array, applying a given mapping function to each value, and returns a new object or array with the mapped values.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `zip` function and the `DeArray` and `Pivot` types?\n- The `zip` function takes any number of arrays and returns a new array of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is taken from the first array, the second element is taken from the second array, and so on. The `DeArray` type is a utility type that extracts the element type of an array. The `Pivot` type is a utility type that takes an array of arrays and returns an array of objects, where each object has a property for each index of the input arrays, and the value of each property is the corresponding element from the input arrays."
