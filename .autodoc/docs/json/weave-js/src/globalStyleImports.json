  "summary": "This code is responsible for importing and organizing various stylesheets used in the larger project called \"weave\". The purpose of this file is to ensure that stylesheets are always loaded and in the correct order, which can prevent styling regressions when code-splitting. \n\nThe code begins with a comment explaining the potential issues with legacy stylesheets and the importance of organizing them properly. It then imports various stylesheets using the \"import\" statement. These stylesheets are located in different directories within the \"weave\" project and include both CSS and LESS files. \n\nSome of the imported stylesheets are from third-party libraries, such as \"katex\" and \"react-toastify\", while others are custom stylesheets specific to the \"weave\" project. The imported stylesheets cover a range of components and elements, including fonts, tables, input fields, and more. \n\nBy importing all of these stylesheets into a single file, the code ensures that they are always loaded in the correct order and that there are no missing styles. This can prevent styling issues and regressions when code-splitting, which is a common technique used to optimize web applications by breaking them into smaller chunks that can be loaded as needed. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the larger \"weave\" project as it ensures that stylesheets are organized and loaded correctly, which can prevent styling issues and improve the user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\n\nimport './styles.css'; // import the main stylesheet for the app\n\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));\n```\n\nIn this example, the main stylesheet for the app is imported alongside the \"App\" component. This ensures that the styles are loaded and applied correctly when the app is rendered.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n    \n    This file is used to import legacy (global) stylesheets to ensure they always load and load in the correct order, preventing styling regressions when code-splitting.\n\n2. What are some of the specific stylesheets being imported in this file?\n    \n    Some of the specific stylesheets being imported in this file include `careyfont-embedded.css`, `JupyterViewer.css`, `Tags.less`, `Toast.css`, `Base.less`, `DragDrop.less`, `EditableField.less`, `Markdown.less`, `NumberInput.less`, `index.css`, `baseTable.css`, `ControlBox.less`, `katex.css`, `styles.css`, `react-datetime.css`, `react-table.css`, and `semantic.min.css`.\n\n3. Why is it important to ensure that stylesheets load in the correct order?\n    \n    Ensuring that stylesheets load in the correct order is important because it prevents styling regressions when code-splitting, which can occur when stylesheets have impacts outside of their intended import area."
