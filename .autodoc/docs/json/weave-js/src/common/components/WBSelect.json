  "summary": "The `WBSelect` component is a UI element that provides a dropdown menu of selectable options. It is part of the larger `weave` project and is implemented using React. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `value`, `options`, `onSelect`, and `menuTheme`. The `value` prop is the currently selected option, while `options` is an array of objects representing the available options. Each option object has a `value` property that is used to identify the option, and a `name` property that is displayed in the dropdown menu. The `onSelect` prop is a callback function that is called when an option is selected, and it is passed the `value` of the selected option as an argument. The `menuTheme` prop is an optional object that can be used to customize the appearance of the dropdown menu.\n\nThe `WBSelect` component can be used in two different modes: basic and typeable. In basic mode, the currently selected option is displayed as text, and clicking on the component opens the dropdown menu. In typeable mode, the component includes an input field that allows the user to type in the name of an option, and the dropdown menu is filtered based on the input. \n\nWhen the component is clicked or focused, it calculates the position of the dropdown menu based on the position of the component in the DOM. The dropdown menu is then displayed using a `WBPopup` component, which is a wrapper around a `div` element that positions itself relative to another element on the page. The `WBMenu` component is then rendered inside the `WBPopup`, displaying the available options. \n\nOverall, the `WBSelect` component provides a flexible and customizable way to allow users to select from a list of options. It can be used in a variety of contexts within the `weave` project, such as selecting a dataset to visualize or choosing a model to train. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { WBSelect } from 'weave';\n\nconst options = [\n  { value: 'option1', name: 'Option 1' },\n  { value: 'option2', name: 'Option 2' },\n  { value: 'option3', name: 'Option 3' },\n];\n\nfunction handleSelect(value) {\n  console.log(`Selected option with value ${value}`);\n}\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Select an option:</h2>\n      <WBSelect\n        value=\"option1\"\n        options={options}\n        onSelect={handleSelect}\n        menuTheme={{ backgroundColor: 'white', color: 'black' }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
