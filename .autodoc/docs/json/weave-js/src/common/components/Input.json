  "summary": "The code above is a React component that wraps the Semantic UI React Input component. The purpose of this wrapper is to avoid a known issue where the input box briefly resets to a saved state before updating to the correct value. This issue occurs when the value is updated asynchronously in the onChange callback, such as when using Redux actions for views.\n\nTo solve this issue, the Input component passes the value as the defaultValue prop, which ensures that the input box has the correct value on mount. However, this approach could cause the value to go out of sync if it can be changed in any way other than modifying this input.\n\nThis component can be used in any React project that uses Semantic UI React and needs to handle input values asynchronously. To use this component, import it from the `weave` module and pass the necessary props, including the value prop, which will be used as the default value.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React, {useState} from 'react';\nimport Input from 'weave/Input';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n\n  const handleInputChange = (event) => {\n    setInputValue(event.target.value);\n    // dispatch Redux action to update view\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Input\n      value={inputValue}\n      onChange={handleInputChange}\n      placeholder=\"Enter text\"\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `MyComponent` component uses the `Input` component from `weave` to handle user input. The `value` prop is set to the `inputValue` state variable, which is updated in the `handleInputChange` function. When the input value changes, a Redux action is dispatched to update the view. The `placeholder` prop is used to display a placeholder text in the input box.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code exports a wrapper component called `Input` that takes in `InputProps` from the `semantic-ui-react` library and passes them down to a `SemanticInput` component with the `value` prop replaced by `defaultValue`.\n\n2. Why is the `defaultValue` prop used instead of `value`?\n   \n   The `defaultValue` prop is used to prevent the input box from briefly resetting to the saved state when the `value` is updated asynchronously in the `onChange` callback. However, this could cause the input value to go out of sync if the source value can be changed in any way other than modifying this input.\n\n3. What is the purpose of destructuring `value` and `...rest` from `props`?\n   \n   The `value` prop is destructured from `props` so that it can be replaced with `defaultValue` when passed down to the `SemanticInput` component. The `...rest` operator is used to pass down any other props that may have been included in `props`."
