  "summary": "The code defines a styled component called `Icon` that renders an icon from the `@wandb/ui` library. The component takes in three props: `size`, `pos`, and `opacity`. The `size` prop is a string that determines the size of the icon and can be one of three values: `small`, `medium`, or `large`. The `pos` prop is a string that determines the position of the icon and can be either `left` or `right`. The `opacity` prop is a number that determines the opacity of the icon.\n\nThe `Icon` component uses the `styled-components` library to define its styles. It also uses an object called `IconVariants` to define the different font sizes for the icon based on the `size` prop. The `IconVariants` object is a mapping of strings to CSS styles defined using the `css` function from `styled-components`.\n\nThe `Icon` component applies the appropriate font size based on the `size` prop by using the `IconVariants` object. It also applies a margin to the icon and adjusts the margin based on the `pos` prop. If `pos` is `left`, the margin is set to `-4px` on the left side of the icon, otherwise it is set to `-4px` on the right side of the icon. The component also sets the display to `flex` and aligns the items to the center. Finally, the component applies the opacity and cursor styles based on the `opacity` and `cursor` props respectively.\n\nThis component can be used throughout the larger project to render icons with consistent styles and sizes. For example, if there is a button component that needs an icon, it can use the `Icon` component and pass in the appropriate props to render the icon with the desired size and position. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Icon } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <Icon size=\"medium\" pos=\"left\" $opacity={0.5} $cursor=\"pointer\" />\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `IconVariants` object?\n   - The `IconVariants` object defines different CSS styles for different sizes of icons.\n2. What props can be passed to the `Icon` component?\n   - The `Icon` component accepts `size` (one of the keys of `IconVariants`), `$pos` (a string), `$opacity` (a number), and `$cursor` (a string) as props.\n3. What is the purpose of the `$pos` prop in the `Icon` component?\n   - The `$pos` prop is used to determine whether the icon should be positioned to the left or right of its container, and adjusts the margin accordingly."
