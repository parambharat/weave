  "summary": "The `AutoCompletingInput` component is a React functional component that provides an input field with autocompletion functionality. It takes in an array of options, a value, and a callback function to be called when an option is selected. It also provides optional callbacks for when the input field is focused or blurred. \n\nThe component renders an input field with a styled component called `BlankInput`. The `BlankInput` component is a styled `input` element with a border, padding, height, and font-family. When the input field is focused, it removes the border and adds a box-shadow with a primary color.\n\nThe `AutoCompletingInput` component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the temporary value of the input field, which is initially set to the value passed in as a prop. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the input element, which is used to set the selection range of the input field. Lastly, it uses the `useEffect` hook to update the temporary value when the value prop changes.\n\nThe component listens for keyboard events on the input field using the `onKeyDown` event handler. If the enter key is pressed, it calls the `onSelect` callback function with the current value of the input field and blurs the input field. If the escape key is pressed, it blurs the input field without calling the `onSelect` callback function.\n\nThe component also listens for input events on the input field using the `onInput` event handler. It checks if the current value of the input field matches any of the options passed in as a prop. If there is a match, it sets the temporary value to the matched option and sets the selection range of the input field to highlight the remaining characters. If there is no match or the backspace key is pressed, it sets the temporary value to the current value of the input field.\n\nThe component provides optional callbacks for when the input field is focused or blurred using the `onFocus` and `onBlur` event handlers. When the input field is focused, it selects the entire value of the input field. When the input field is blurred, it checks if the temporary value matches any of the options passed in as a prop. If it does, it calls the `onSelect` callback function with the temporary value. If it doesn't, it sets the temporary value to the value passed in as a prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to provide autocompletion functionality for input fields. For example, it can be used in a search bar to suggest search terms as the user types. Here is an example usage of the `AutoCompletingInput` component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport AutoCompletingInput from './AutoCompletingInput';\n\nconst options = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'];\n\nconst SearchBar = () => {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  const handleSelect = (val) => {\n    setValue(val);\n    // perform search with selected value\n  };\n  return (\n    <AutoCompletingInput\n      options={options}\n      value={value}\n      onSelect={handleSelect}\n      placeholder=\"Search...\"\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SearchBar;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AutoCompletingInput` component?\n- The `AutoCompletingInput` component is a React functional component that renders an input field with autocomplete functionality based on a list of options.\n\n2. What are the required and optional props for the `AutoCompletingInput` component?\n- The required props for the `AutoCompletingInput` component are `options` and `onSelect`, while the optional props are `className`, `value`, `disabled`, `onBlur`, and `onFocus`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BlankInput` styled component?\n- The `BlankInput` styled component is a styled `input` element that has no border, a specific height and padding, and a box shadow when focused.
