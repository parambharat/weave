  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `ShowMoreContainer`. This component is designed to display a list of child elements, with the option to show or hide the full list by clicking on an icon. \n\nThe component takes in three props: `children`, an array of JSX elements to be displayed; `className`, an optional string to add a custom class to the component; and `iconSize`, an optional prop that specifies the size of the icon used to toggle the list. \n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the list is open or closed. Initially, the list is closed (`open` is set to `false`). When the icon is clicked, the `onClick` function toggles the value of `open` to show or hide the full list. \n\nThe component renders a `div` that contains an icon and the child elements. The icon is an instance of the `LegacyWBIcon` component, which is imported from another file in the project. The icon is styled to rotate 90 degrees when the list is open, and has a cursor pointer to indicate that it is clickable. The child elements are contained within another `div` that has a `maxHeight` property set to `undefined` when the list is open, allowing the full list to be displayed. When the list is closed, the `maxHeight` property is set to `32`, which limits the height of the list and hides any elements that exceed that height. \n\nThe `ShowMoreContainer` component is exported as a memoized version of the `ShowMoreContainerComp` function using the `React.memo` method. This optimizes performance by only re-rendering the component when its props have changed. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger `weave` project to display lists of items that may be too long to display in their entirety. By providing a toggle to show or hide the full list, the component allows users to view the information they need without overwhelming them with too much content at once. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {ShowMoreContainer} from 'weave';\n\nconst items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3', 'Item 4', 'Item 5'];\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <ShowMoreContainer iconSize='large'>\n      {items.map((item, index) => (\n        <div key={index}>{item}</div>\n      ))}\n    </ShowMoreContainer>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LegacyWBIcon` component imported from `./elements/LegacyWBIcon`?\n   - It is unclear from the code what the `LegacyWBIcon` component does or how it is used. A smart developer might want to know more about this component's implementation and purpose.\n\n2. Why is the `maxHeight` style property conditionally set based on the `open` state?\n   - A smart developer might wonder why the `maxHeight` style property is set to `undefined` when `open` is true, and what effect this has on the rendered output.\n\n3. Why is the `ShowMoreContainer` component wrapped in `React.memo`?\n   - A smart developer might want to know why the `ShowMoreContainer` component is memoized using `React.memo`, and what performance benefits this provides."
