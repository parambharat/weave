  "summary": "The `WBQueryMenu` component is a React component that extends the `WBMenu` component. It is designed to provide a menu with options that can be fetched from an API or provided as an array. The component supports infinite scrolling and sorting of options based on a score function. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `options`, `scrollerElement`, `scrollThreshold`, `pageSize`, `sortScoreFn`, `infiniteScroll`, and `onResolvedOptions`. The `options` prop can either be an array of `WBMenuOption` objects or a function that returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with an array of `WBMenuOption` objects and a `nextPageCursor` string. The `scrollerElement` prop is an optional `HTMLElement` that is used as the scroll container for infinite scrolling. The `scrollThreshold` prop is the number of pixels from the bottom of the scroll container at which point the component will load more options. The `pageSize` prop is the number of options to fetch at a time. The `sortScoreFn` prop is a function that takes in a `WBMenuOption` object and returns a number that is used to sort the options. The `infiniteScroll` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not to use infinite scrolling. The `onResolvedOptions` prop is a function that is called with the resolved options when they are fetched.\n\nThe component uses `React.useState` to manage the state of the component, including `loading`, `computedOptions`, and `nextPageCursor`. It also uses `React.useRef` to keep track of the last query that was run. The component uses `React.useEffect` to handle the fetching of options and to add and remove event listeners for scrolling. \n\nIf the `options` prop is a function, the component will fetch the initial options and set the `loading` state to `true`. Once the options are fetched, the `loading` state is set to `false`, the `computedOptions` state is set to the fetched options, and the `onResolvedOptions` prop is called with the fetched options. If the `options` prop is an array, the component will set the `computedOptions` state to the array of options and call the `onResolvedOptions` prop with the options. \n\nIf `infiniteScroll` is `true`, the component will add an event listener to the `scrollerElement` that will call the `loadMore` function when the user scrolls to the bottom of the container. The `loadMore` function will fetch more options and add them to the `computedOptions` state. If `infiniteScroll` is `false`, the component will sort the `computedOptions` state based on the `sortScoreFn` prop.\n\nThe `modifiedOptions` variable is used to modify the `computedOptions` state based on the `loading` state. If `loading` is `true`, a loading option is added to the end of the `computedOptions` state. If `computedOptions` is empty, a \"No matches\" option is added to the `modifiedOptions` state.\n\nThe component returns the `WBMenu` component with the `modifiedOptions` state as the `options` prop. The `ref` prop is used to set the `defaultScrollerElement` state.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `WBQueryMenu` component?\n- The `WBQueryMenu` component is a modified version of the `WBMenu` component that allows for querying and sorting of menu options.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `WBMenuOptionFetcher` type?\n- The `WBMenuOptionFetcher` type is a function type that defines the shape of a function that fetches menu options. It takes in an object with a cursor and count property and returns a promise that resolves to an object with nextPageCursor and options properties.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `infiniteScroll` prop?\n- The `infiniteScroll` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not the menu options should be loaded infinitely as the user scrolls. If set to true, the menu options will be loaded in chunks as the user scrolls down the menu."
