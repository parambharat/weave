  "summary": "The `NumberInput` module is a React component that provides a user interface for entering numerical values. It is designed to be used in a larger project where numerical input is required. The component provides a text input field that accepts numerical values, and can be configured with various options such as minimum and maximum values, step size, and tick marks. It also provides an optional stepper control that allows the user to increment or decrement the value using up and down arrows.\n\nThe component is implemented as a functional component that accepts a set of properties as input. These properties include the initial value of the input field, the minimum and maximum allowed values, and various styling options. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the current value of the input field, and the `useEffect` hook to update the value when the `value` property changes.\n\nThe `shiftValue` function is used to update the value of the input field when the user clicks on the stepper controls or uses the up and down arrow keys. It takes the current value of the input field, the direction of the change (up or down), and the step size as input, and computes the new value based on these inputs. If tick marks are specified, the new value is rounded to the nearest tick mark. If no tick marks are specified, the new value is incremented or decremented by the step size.\n\nThe `NumberInput` component is exported as a default export, which means that it can be imported into other modules using the `import` statement. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport NumberInput from 'weave/NumberInput';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleChange = (newValue) => {\n    setValue(newValue);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <NumberInput\n      value={value}\n      min={0}\n      max={100}\n      strideLength={10}\n      ticks={[0, 25, 50, 75, 100]}\n      onChange={handleChange}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `NumberInput` component is used to render a numerical input field with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 100, and tick marks at 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100. The `strideLength` property is set to 10, which means that the value will be incremented or decremented by 10 when the user clicks on the stepper controls or uses the up and down arrow keys. The `onChange` property is set to a callback function that updates the state of the parent component when the value of the input field changes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `NumberInput` component?\n- The `NumberInput` component is a React functional component that renders an input field for numeric values with optional stepper buttons and tick marks.\n\n2. What are the props that can be passed to the `NumberInput` component?\n- The `NumberInput` component accepts several props including `className`, `value`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, `stepper`, `ticks`, `min`, `max`, `containerStyle`, `inputStyle`, `strideLength`, and `onChange`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `shiftValue` function?\n- The `shiftValue` function is a callback function that is called when the user presses the up or down arrow keys or clicks on the stepper buttons. It updates the value of the input field based on the direction of the shift and the available ticks or stride length."
