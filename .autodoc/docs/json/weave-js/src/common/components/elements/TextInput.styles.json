  "summary": "This code defines three styled components that can be used in the larger project called \"weave\". The first component is called \"Input\" and is a styled version of the Semantic UI React Input component. It sets the width to 100% and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original Input component.\n\nThe second component is called \"Label\" and is a styled label element. It sets the display to block, sets the font weight to six times the standard font weight, sets the font size to 1.222 times the standard font size, sets the line height to 1.5 times the standard line height, and sets the margin bottom to half of the standard spacing unit. This component can be used to create labels for form inputs.\n\nThe third component is called \"Sublabel\" and is a styled span element. It sets the color to a gray color defined in the global styles file. This component can be used to create sublabels for form inputs.\n\nThese components can be imported and used in other files within the \"weave\" project. For example, the Input component can be used in a form component like this:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {Input, Label, Sublabel} from './components';\n\nconst MyForm = () => {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <Label>First Name</Label>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter your first name\" />\n      <Sublabel>This is your given name.</Sublabel>\n      <Label>Last Name</Label>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter your last name\" />\n      <Sublabel>This is your family name.</Sublabel>\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThis code creates a form with two inputs, each with a label and sublabel. The labels and sublabels are styled using the Label and Sublabel components defined in the code above. The Input components are styled using the Input component defined in the code above.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of importing from 'semantic-ui-react'?\n- The code is importing the `Input` component from the 'semantic-ui-react' library to use in the `Input` styled component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `calc()` function used in the `Label` styled component?\n- The `calc()` function is used to perform calculations with CSS values. In this case, it is used to calculate the font-weight, font-size, and line-height values based on the standard values defined in the `globals.styles` file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Sublabel` styled component?\n- The `Sublabel` styled component is used to style a span element that will be used as a sublabel for the `Input` component. It sets the color of the text to a gray color defined in the `globals.styles` file."
