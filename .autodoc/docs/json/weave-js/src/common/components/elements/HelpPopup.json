  "summary": "The `HelpPopup` component is a React functional component that renders a help icon with a popup containing help text. The component takes two props: `helpText` which is the text to be displayed in the popup, and `docUrl` which is an optional URL to a documentation page. \n\nThe component uses the `Icon` and `Popup` components from the `semantic-ui-react` library to render the help icon and the popup respectively. The `TargetBlank` component from the `util/links` module is used to render the `docUrl` prop as a hyperlink that opens in a new tab.\n\nThe `popup` variable is assigned the `Popup` component with the `inverted`, `size`, `className`, `trigger`, and `content` props set. The `inverted` prop sets the popup to have a dark background with light text, while the `size` prop sets the size of the popup to \"mini\". The `className` prop sets the class name of the popup content to \"help-popup-content\". The `trigger` prop sets the help icon as the trigger for the popup, while the `content` prop sets the `helpText` prop as the content of the popup.\n\nThe `returnVal` variable is assigned a ternary expression that checks if the `docUrl` prop is not null. If it is not null, the `TargetBlank` component is used to wrap the `popup` variable, passing the `docUrl` prop as the `href` prop. If it is null, the `popup` variable is returned as is.\n\nFinally, the component returns a `span` element with the class name \"help-popup\" and the `returnVal` variable as its child.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide help text and documentation links for various UI elements. For example, a button component could use this `HelpPopup` component to display a help icon with a popup containing information on what the button does, as well as a link to the documentation page for the button. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<HelpPopup helpText=\"Click this button to submit the form\" docUrl=\"https://example.com/docs/form-submit\" />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines a React component called `HelpPopup` that renders a help icon with a popup containing help text and an optional link to documentation.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n   \n   This code imports two components from the `semantic-ui-react` library and one component from a custom `links` module.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior if `docUrl` is not provided as a prop?\n   \n   If `docUrl` is not provided, the component will render the help icon with a popup containing only the `helpText` prop."
