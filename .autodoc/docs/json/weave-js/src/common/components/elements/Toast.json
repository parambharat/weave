  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports two functions and a React component. The module imports React, createElement, and FC from the 'react' library, and toastify, ToastifyContainer, ToastContent, and ToastOptions from the 'react-toastify' library. It also imports LegacyWBIcon from another module in the project.\n\nThe ToastContainer component is a functional component that returns a ToastifyContainer component from the 'react-toastify' library. The ToastifyContainer component is a container for toast notifications that appear on the screen. The ToastContainer component sets the position of the toast notifications to the top right of the screen, hides the progress bar, and sets the class names for the container and the toast notifications. The component also sets a custom close button for the toast notifications using the closeButton prop. The closeButton prop is a function that returns a LegacyWBIcon component from another module in the project. The LegacyWBIcon component is an icon that is used as the close button for the toast notifications.\n\nThe toast function is a wrapper around the toastify function from the 'react-toastify' library. The toast function takes two arguments: text and options. The text argument is the message that will be displayed in the toast notification. The options argument is an optional object that can be used to customize the toast notification. The toast function simply calls the toastify function with the text and options arguments.\n\nOverall, this module provides a way to display toast notifications in the project using the 'react-toastify' library. The ToastContainer component provides a container for the toast notifications, and the toast function provides a simple way to display the notifications. The LegacyWBIcon component is used as the close button for the toast notifications, and it is imported from another module in the project. This module can be used in any part of the project where toast notifications need to be displayed. For example, it can be used to display success or error messages after a user performs an action on the website. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {ToastContainer, toast} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    // perform some action\n    toast('Action completed successfully!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Perform Action</button>\n      <ToastContainer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code is a part of the `weave` project, but without more context it is unclear what the overall purpose of the project is.\n\n2. What is the `LegacyWBIcon` component and how is it used in this code?\n- The `LegacyWBIcon` component is imported from another file and used as the close button for the toast notification.\n\n3. What are the available options for the `toast` function and how are they used?\n- The `toast` function takes in a `text` parameter for the content of the toast notification and an optional `options` parameter for additional configuration. The `toastify` function from the `react-toastify` library is used to actually display the notification."
