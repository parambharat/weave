  "summary": "The code above is a React component called `PanelError` that renders an error message with an icon. The component takes two props: `message` and `className`. The `message` prop is a React child that represents the error message to be displayed, while the `className` prop is an optional string that can be used to add custom CSS classes to the component.\n\nThe component imports two external libraries: `@wandb/ui` and `classnames`. The `@wandb/ui` library provides an icon component called `WBIcon`, which is used to render an icon alongside the error message. The `classnames` library is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to the component based on the `className` prop.\n\nThe `PanelError` component is defined as a functional component using the `React.FC` type. The component is wrapped in the `React.memo` higher-order component, which memoizes the component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with the class name `panel-error`. Inside the `div`, there is another `div` element that contains the icon and the error message. The icon is rendered using the `WBIcon` component from the `@wandb/ui` library, and the error message is rendered using the `message` prop.\n\nThe `PanelError` component can be used in the larger project to display error messages in a consistent and visually appealing way. The component can be imported and used in other React components like this:\n\n```\nimport PanelError from './PanelError';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PanelError message=\"An error occurred!\" className=\"my-custom-class\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `PanelError` component is used to display an error message with the text \"An error occurred!\" and a custom CSS class called \"my-custom-class\". The component can be customized further by passing additional props or by modifying the CSS styles.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelError` component?\n   - The `PanelError` component is used to display an error message with an icon.\n\n2. What are the required and optional props for the `PanelError` component?\n   - The required prop for the `PanelError` component is `message`, which should be a React child element. The optional prop is `className`, which is a string used to add additional CSS classes to the component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `React.memo` function in this code?\n   - The `React.memo` function is used to memoize the `PanelError` component, which means that it will only re-render if its props have changed. This can improve performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders."
