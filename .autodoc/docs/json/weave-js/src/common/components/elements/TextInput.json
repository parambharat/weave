  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `TextInput` that renders an input field with a label and an optional sublabel. The component takes in several props, including `dataTest`, `label`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `sublabel`, and `value`. \n\nIf the `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook returns `true`, the component renders a different component called `TextInputNew` instead of the default input field. This is likely a customization for a specific use case within the larger project.\n\nOtherwise, the component renders a label with the `label` and `sublabel` props, and an input field with the `placeholder`, `value`, and `onChange` props. \n\nThis component can be used throughout the larger project wherever a text input field is needed. Developers can customize the label and sublabel text, as well as the placeholder and initial value of the input field. The `onChange` prop allows developers to specify a function to be called whenever the input value changes. \n\nHere is an example of how the `TextInput` component can be used in a parent component:\n\n```\nimport React, {useState} from 'react';\nimport {TextInput} from './weave/TextInput';\n\nconst ParentComponent = () => {\n  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n\n  const handleInputChange = (e, {value}) => {\n    setInputValue(value);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TextInput\n        dataTest=\"my-input\"\n        label=\"Enter your name:\"\n        sublabel=\"(optional)\"\n        placeholder=\"John Doe\"\n        value={inputValue}\n        onChange={handleInputChange}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ParentComponent` renders a `TextInput` component with a label, sublabel, placeholder, and initial value. It also passes in a function called `handleInputChange` to the `onChange` prop, which updates the state of the `inputValue` variable whenever the input value changes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook is used to determine whether the Weave Dash UI is enabled or not. It is used to conditionally render the `TextInputNew` component if the UI is enabled.\n2. What is the difference between the `TextInput` component and the `TextInputNew` component?\n   - The code does not provide enough information to answer this question. It would require examining the implementation of the `TextInputNew` component to determine its differences from `TextInput`.\n3. What is the purpose of the `FC` type in the import statement for React?\n   - The `FC` type is a shorthand for the `FunctionComponent` type, which is a type definition for a React functional component. It is used to define the type of the `TextInput` component."
