  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `LegacyWBIcon`. This component is a wrapper around the `Icon` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library, with some additional functionality specific to the `weave` project.\n\nThe `LegacyWBIcon` component accepts several props, including `name`, `title`, `size`, `rotated`, `link`, `className`, `onClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `style`, and `data-test`. These props are passed down to the `Icon` component, with the exception of `className`, which is used to construct a custom class name that includes the `name` prop.\n\nThe `LegacyWBIcon` component also accepts a `ref` prop, which is passed down to the `Ref` component from `semantic-ui-react`. This allows the parent component to access the underlying DOM node of the `Icon` component.\n\nThe `LegacyWBIcon` component is memoized using the `memo` function from React, which helps to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed.\n\nOverall, the `LegacyWBIcon` component provides a convenient way to use icons from the `semantic-ui-react` library within the `weave` project, while also adding some custom functionality specific to the project. Here is an example of how the `LegacyWBIcon` component might be used:\n\n```\nimport { LegacyWBIcon } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <LegacyWBIcon name=\"user\" size=\"large\" />\n      <LegacyWBIcon name=\"settings\" size=\"large\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `LegacyWBIcon` that renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Icon` component with additional props.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `IconSizeProp` type?\n- The `IconSizeProp` type defines a set of valid values for the `size` prop of the `LegacyWBIcon` component, which correspond to different sizes of the rendered icon.\n\n3. Why is `LegacyWBIconComp` defined using `React.forwardRef`?\n- `LegacyWBIconComp` is defined using `React.forwardRef` so that it can pass a `ref` to the `Icon` component rendered inside it, allowing the parent component to access the `Icon`'s DOM node if needed."
