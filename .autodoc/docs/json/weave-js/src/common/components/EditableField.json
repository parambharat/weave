  "summary": "The `EditableField` component is a generic component for any editable text. It is designed to be used in a larger project where there is a need for a user to edit text fields. The component is built using React and Semantic UI React, and it supports different props and less mixin parameters.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including `icon`, `label`, `value`, `updateValue`, `displayValue`, `placeholder`, `readOnly`, `multiline`, `type`, `autoSelect`, `maxLength`, `asHeader`, `className`, `showEditIcon`, `renderLinks`, `save`, and `overrideClick`. These props are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the component.\n\nThe component has two states: `editing` and `not editing`. When the component is not editing, it displays the current value of the text field. When the component is editing, it displays an input field where the user can edit the text. The component also supports multiline text fields.\n\nThe `EditableField` component uses the `getDerivedStateFromProps` method to update the state of the component when the `value` prop changes. The `save` method is used to debounce the save action to prevent multiple saves from happening at once. The `startEditing`, `stopEditing`, and `cancelEditing` methods are used to handle the editing state of the component. The `onKeyDown` and `onKeyDownMultiline` methods are used to handle keyboard events when editing the text field.\n\nThe `updateValue` method is used to update the state of the component when the user edits the text field. The `render` method is used to render the component based on its current state and props.\n\nOverall, the `EditableField` component is a flexible and customizable component that can be used in a variety of contexts where there is a need for a user to edit text fields.",
