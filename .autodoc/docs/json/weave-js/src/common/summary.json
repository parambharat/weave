      "summary": "This code defines various font faces and sets some global CSS variables. The `@font-face` rules define custom fonts for use in the project. The `graphein` font family is defined with different weights and styles, while the `panel-icons` font family is defined with multiple formats for cross-browser compatibility. \n\nThe `body` selector sets some basic styles for the entire page, including setting the font family to `graphein`. The `:root` selector sets global CSS variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables define various colors that can be used consistently across the project, making it easier to maintain a consistent visual style.\n\nOverall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project, as it sets up some basic styles and fonts that will be used throughout the site. Here is an example of how the global CSS variables could be used in other parts of the project:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--primaryColor);\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a `.button` class that uses the `--primaryColor` variable for the background color. This ensures that all buttons on the site will have a consistent color, and makes it easy to change the color site-wide by simply updating the `--primaryColor` variable in one place.",
      "questions": "1. What fonts are being used in this project?\n- The project is using the 'graphein' font family and the 'panel-icons' font family.\n\n2.

Each icon is assigned a unique Unicode code point that is displayed in a span element with the class \"i-code\". The name of the icon is displayed in a span element with the class \"i-name\".\n\nThe web page is divided into three main sections: the header, the icons, and the footer. The header contains the title of the page and a switch that toggles the display of the icon codes. The icons section contains several rows of icons, each row containing four icons. The footer contains a link to the website that generated the font.\n\nThe code uses the Bootstrap framework to define the layout and styling of the page. The Bootstrap classes are used to define the container, row, and span elements that are used to create a responsive grid layout. The code also defines several custom styles that are used to style the icons and the switch.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for displaying a set of icons on a web page. The code can be used in conjunction with other web development tools and frameworks to create more complex web applications. For example, the icons could be used as part of a navigation menu or as part of a user interface for a web application. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo use the icons in a web page, the HTML code can be copied and pasted into the body of the page. The CSS and font files should be included in the head section of the page using the link and style tags. The icons can then be displayed using the <i> tag with the class \"demo-icon\".

The animation is defined using the \"spin\" keyframes, which specify the starting and ending states of the animation. The animation lasts for 2 seconds and repeats infinitely, with a linear timing function that ensures a smooth and consistent rotation speed.\n\nThe keyframes are defined using vendor-specific prefixes for compatibility with different browsers, including -moz- for Mozilla Firefox, -o- for Opera, -webkit- for Google Chrome and Safari, and -ms- for Microsoft Edge. The keyframes specify the rotation angle of the element at different points in time, from 0 degrees at the start to 359 degrees at the end, which creates a full rotation.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to create a variety of spinner animations, such as loading indicators or progress bars, that provide visual feedback to the user while a task is being performed. For example, the following HTML code could be used to display a spinner with this animation:\n\n```\n<div class=\"animate-spin\">\n  <img src=\"spinner.png\" alt=\"Loading...\">\n</div>\n```\n\nThis would display an image of a spinner that rotates continuously using the \"spin\" animation defined in this code.

The `App` component might be used in the main entry point of the application, like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport App from './common/containers/App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n```\n\n2. **`SomeContainer.js`**: This file is a placeholder for other container components that might be added to the project. These container components would be responsible for managing the state and logic for specific parts of the application. For example, a `UserContainer` component might be responsible for fetching user data and passing it down to a `UserList` presentational component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { fetchUsers } from '../actions/userActions';\nimport UserList from '../components/UserList';\n\nclass UserContainer extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.fetchUsers();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <UserList users={this.props.users} />;\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  users: state.users\n});\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = {\n  fetchUsers\n};\n\nexport default connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(UserContainer);\n```\n\n### Subfolders\n\nThere are no subfolders in the `common/containers` folder.\n\nIn summary, the `common/containers` folder contains the container components that manage the state and logic of the application. These components are responsible for connecting to the Redux store, fetching data, and passing it down to presentational components. The main `App` container component serves as the root component for the entire application, while other container components like `SomeContainer.js` (or any other container components added to the project) manage specific parts of the application.",

          "summary": "The `DragDrop.less` file is a part of the `weave` project and contains styling rules for drag and drop functionality. The purpose of this code is to provide a visual cue to the user that an element can be dragged and dropped. \n\nThe code imports the `globals.less` file, which likely contains global styling rules for the entire project. The `.drag-drop-handle` class is defined with a `cursor` property set to `grab`, which changes the cursor to a hand icon when the user hovers over an element with this class. When the user clicks and holds the element, the `:active` pseudo-class is applied, changing the cursor to a grabbing icon. This provides a visual cue to the user that the element is being dragged.\n\nThis code can be used in conjunction with JavaScript code that handles the actual drag and drop functionality. For example, a developer could use this code to style a draggable element with the `.drag-drop-handle` class and then use JavaScript to handle the drag and drop events. \n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in a larger project:\n\nHTML:\n```\n<div class=\"drag-drop-handle\">\n  Drag me!\n</div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n```\n@import './DragDrop.less';\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n```\nconst draggable = document.querySelector('.drag-drop-handle');\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag start event\n});\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragend', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag end event\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `DragDrop.less` file is imported into the project's main CSS file. The `.drag-drop-handle` class is applied to a `div` element in the HTML, which is then selected in JavaScript and given event listeners for the `dragstart` and `dragend` events. When the user clicks and holds the element, the cursor changes to a grabbing icon, indicating that the element is being dragged.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines the styling for a drag and drop handle in the Weave project.\n\n2. What other files does this code depend on?\n   This code imports the `globals.less` file, so it likely depends on variables and mixins defined in that file.\n\n3. Are there any browser compatibility concerns with this code?\n   The use of the `grab` and `grabbing` cursor values may not be supported in all browsers, so a smart developer may want to check for compatibility issues and provide fallback options if necessary."

The mixin takes several parameters that can be customized, such as the size and color of the icon, the font size and color of the label and field, and the placeholder color.\n\nThe mixin uses flexbox to align the icon, label, and field content vertically. The icon is a font icon that is styled with the specified size and color, and is positioned to the left of the label. The label is styled with the specified font size, color, and text transform, and is given a fixed width. The field content is styled with the specified font size, color, opacity, and line height, and is given padding and a border radius to create a rounded rectangle. If the field content is empty, a placeholder text with the specified color is displayed.\n\nWhen the editable field is not read-only, hovering over it changes the background color of the field content to a light gray and changes the cursor to a pointer. If the editable field is a URL field, a \"http://\" prefix is displayed before the input field, and a \"go to link\" icon is displayed to the right of the input field.\n\nThe `editable-field-mixin` can be used in other files in the `weave` project to style editable fields consistently. For example, if a form in the project has several editable fields, the `editable-field-mixin` can be applied to each field to ensure that they all have the same styling. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n.editable-field {\n  @import './editable-field.less';\n  .editable-field-mixin();\n}\n```",

The component consists of a container that holds both a stepper and an input field. The stepper allows the user to increment or decrement the value in the input field. \n\nThe `number-input` class is the main class for the component. It contains two child classes: `__container` and `__stepper`. The `__container` class sets the display property to flex, which allows the child elements to be aligned horizontally. The `__stepper` class also sets the display property to flex, but with a column direction. This allows the stepper buttons to be aligned vertically. The `justify-content` property centers the buttons vertically within the container. The `z-index` property sets the stacking order of the stepper buttons, and the `margin-left` property positions the stepper to the left of the input field. The `color` property sets the color of the stepper buttons to a gray color defined in the `globals.less` file.\n\nThe `__input` class sets the width of the input field to 10 times the value of `@spu`, which is a variable defined in the `globals.less` file. This ensures that the input field is wide enough to accommodate the largest possible value.\n\nThis code can be used to style a number input component in the Weave project.

The component can reference the font family and apply the appropriate weight and style to the code text based on the user's preferences or the default styling defined in the project.\n\n```css\n.code-snippet {\n  font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\nThis would apply the regular weight of the Source Code Pro font family to the text in an element with the class 'code-snippet'.\n\n### source-sans-pro.css\n\nThis file defines font styles for the Source Sans Pro font family in various weights and styles. The `@font-face` rule is used to specify the font family, style, weight, and source of the font files. The `src` property specifies the location of the font files in different formats, such as WOFF and WOFF2, which are supported by different browsers.\n\nBy defining the font styles in this way, the website or application can reference the font family in its CSS and apply the desired font weight and style to different elements. For example, the following CSS rule could be used to apply the regular weight of the Source Sans Pro font to all paragraphs on a website:\n\n```css\np {\n  font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\nThis code is part of the larger project, which likely includes other CSS and HTML files that reference the Source Sans Pro font family and apply it to different elements. By defining the font styles in a separate file, the project can ensure consistency in the appearance of text across different pages and sections of the website or application.",

This class can be used in conjunction with JavaScript code to handle drag and drop events:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"drag-drop-handle\">\n  Drag me!\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n@import './DragDrop.less';\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst draggable = document.querySelector('.drag-drop-handle');\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag start event\n});\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragend', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag end event\n});\n```\n\nThe `EditableField.less` file defines the `.editable-field` class, which uses the `editable-field-mixin()` mixin to style editable fields consistently across the project:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"editable-field\">\n  This text is editable.\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `IFrameResets.less` file provides classes to control the visibility and positioning of elements when displayed within an iframe:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"hide-in-iframe\">This element will be hidden in an iframe</div>\n<div class=\"show-in-iframe\">This element will only be displayed in an iframe</div>\n```\n\nThe `Markdown.less` file defines styling for markdown content, ensuring a consistent appearance across the project:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"markdown\">\n  <h1>My Markdown File</h1>\n  <p>This is some text in my markdown file.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `NumberInput.less` file provides styles for a number input component with stepper buttons:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"number-input\">\n  <div class=\"number-input__container\">\n    <div class=\"number-input__stepper\">\n      <button>+</button>\n      <button>-</button>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"number\" class=\"number-input__input\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `animations.less` file defines several CSS animations that can be applied to elements for visual effects:\n\n```css\n.my-element {\n  animation: fade-in 1s;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the `globals.less` file contains global variables for styling, ensuring consistency across the project. These variables can be used in other files to reference colors, font sizes, and other visual properties.\n\nIn summary, the code in this folder provides a collection of reusable styles and mixins for various components and elements in the Weave project. By using these files, developers can ensure a consistent look and feel across the project and easily maintain and update the styling as needed.",

The `useEffect` hook is called with a function that sets a timestamp `x` when the component is mounted and returns another function that sets a timestamp `y` when the component is unmounted. The difference between `x` and `y` is the duration that the component was mounted.\n\nThe `cb` function is called with an object that contains the `id` of the component, the `start` timestamp `x`, the `stop` timestamp `y`, and the `duration` of the component.

It takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with the keys in `U` required. `Subset` requires only a subset of keys from the given type. It takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with only the keys in `U` required.\n\n`DeepPartial` takes a type `T` and returns a new type that is the same as `T`, but with all properties marked as optional. `PartialSome` takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with the keys in `U` optional.\n\n`Parameters` takes a function type `F` and returns a tuple of the parameter types of `F`.\n\nFinally, there are two interfaces `Match` and `MatchParams` that define the shape of URL parameters from a Route component. These interfaces can be used to enforce type safety when working with URL parameters.\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of generic type helpers that can be used throughout the larger project to enforce type safety and make it easier to work with complex types.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `RequireSome` and `Subset` types?\n- `RequireSome` requires a subset of keys from an object to be present and non-null, while allowing other keys to be optional.\n- `Subset` requires only a subset of keys from an object to be present and non-null, while allowing other keys to be optional.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Match` and `MatchParams` interfaces?\n- `Match` represents the result of matching a URL path to a route, including information about the matched path and any parameters extracted from it.\n- `MatchParams` is an interface defining the possible parameters that can be extracted from a URL path match.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `DeepPartial` type?\n- `DeepPartial` is a type that makes all properties of an object optional, including nested properties, allowing for partial updates of deeply nested objects."

          "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `Tag` that is used to represent a tag object. A tag is a label that can be attached to an item to help categorize or organize it. The `Tag` interface has three properties: `name`, `colorIndex`, and `icon`. \n\nThe `name` property is a string that represents the name of the tag. This is the only required property for a tag object. The `colorIndex` property is an optional number that represents the color of the tag. This property is used to assign a color to the tag, which can help visually distinguish it from other tags. The `icon` property is also optional and represents an icon that can be associated with the tag. This property is used to provide additional visual cues to help identify the tag.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to define the structure of tag objects that are used throughout the application. By defining a consistent interface for tags, the application can ensure that all tags have the required properties and can be used interchangeably. This can help simplify the code and make it easier to work with tags throughout the application.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Tag` interface might be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Tag } from 'weave';\n\nconst myTag: Tag = {\n  name: 'My Tag',\n  colorIndex: 2,\n  icon: 'tag',\n};\n\nconsole.log(myTag.name); // Output: 'My Tag'\nconsole.log(myTag.colorIndex); // Output: 2\nconsole.log(myTag.icon); // Output: 'tag'\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `Tag` interface from the `weave` module. We then create a new tag object called `myTag` that has a name of 'My Tag', a color index of 2, and an icon of 'tag'. We can then access the properties of the `myTag` object using dot notation.",
          "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `Tag` interface?** \nThe `Tag` interface defines the structure of an object that represents a tag, which includes a name, an optional color index, and an optional icon from the Semantic UI React library.\n\n2. **What is the `SemanticICONS` import used for?** \nThe `SemanticICONS` import is used to define the type of the `icon` property in the `Tag` interface. It ensures that only valid Semantic UI React icons can be used as tag icons.\n\n3. **How is the `colorIndex` property used in the `Tag` interface?** \nThe `colorIndex` property is optional and can be used to specify a color index for the tag. The specific use of this property is not defined in this code and would need to be determined by examining the rest of the codebase."

          "summary": "The code above defines a set of interfaces and types that are used to represent JSON objects and their values. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to define and manipulate JSON objects in a type-safe manner.\n\nThe `JSONObject` interface represents a JSON object, which is essentially a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings and the values can be of any type, including other JSON objects or arrays. The `Primitive` type represents simple values that can be directly represented in JSON, such as strings, numbers, and booleans. The `Arr` interface represents an array of values, which can also include other JSON objects or arrays. Finally, the `Value` type represents any valid JSON value, which can be a primitive, an object, or an array.\n\nThese interfaces and types can be used throughout the larger project to define and manipulate JSON data. For example, if the project needs to send a JSON payload to an API, it can define the payload as a `JSONObject` and populate it with the necessary key-value pairs. If the project needs to parse a JSON response from an API, it can use these interfaces and types to ensure that the response is properly formatted and type-safe.\n\nHere is an example of how these interfaces and types can be used:\n\n```typescript\n// Define a JSON object with a nested array\nconst myObj: JSONObject = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  hobbies: [\"reading\", \"writing\", \"coding\"]\n};\n\n// Access a value in the object\nconst name: string = myObj.name;\n\n// Iterate over the array\nmyObj.hobbies.forEach(hobby => {\n  console.log(hobby);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `JSONObject` with a `name` key that maps to a string, an `age` key that maps to a number, and a `hobbies` key that maps to an array of strings. We can access the `name` value using dot notation, and we can iterate over the `hobbies` array using a `forEach` loop. By using these interfaces and types, we can ensure that our JSON data is properly formatted and type-safe throughout our project.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `JSONObject` interface?\n   - The `JSONObject` interface represents an object that can be encrypted as valid JSON, with keys as strings and values as either a `Value` or `null`.\n\n2. What is the `Value` type used for?\n   - The `Value` type is used to represent a value that can be a primitive (string, number, boolean), a `JSONObject`, or an `Arr` (an array of `Value`s).\n\n3. Why is the `Arr` interface defined separately instead of just using `Value[]`?\n   - The `Arr` interface is defined separately to allow for more specific typing and to make it clear that the array should only contain `Value` types."

The `BoundingBoxFileData` interface specifies the data for a bounding box file, including the box data and class labels. The `Mask` interface defines a mask and its associated class labels.\n\nThe `BoundingBox2D` and `BoundingBox3D` interfaces define 2D and 3D bounding boxes, respectively. The `returnIfBoundingBox2D` and `returnIfBoundingBox3D` functions return the appropriate type of bounding box based on its type property.\n\nThe `AudioMetadata` interface defines the properties of an audio file, including its sample rate and duration.

The function could then use the selected value to set the representation type for the molecular structure. \n\n```typescript\nimport { RepresentationType, RepresentationTypeValues } from 'weave';\n\nfunction setRepresentationType(representationType: RepresentationType) {\n  // Set the representation type for the molecular structure\n}\n\n// Populate a dropdown menu with the RepresentationTypeValues array\n```\n\nThe code in the `ipynb` folder is responsible for importing and exporting types related to the nbformat schema used in the weave project. The nbformat schema is crucial for validating the structure and data types of a Jupyter Notebook file, ensuring that it follows the correct format and contains the necessary properties.\n\nThe `index.ts` file imports all types from the `nbformat.v4.schema` file and exports specific types that are needed in the larger project. These exported types include `NbformatSchema`, `Cell`, `DisplayData`, and `ExecuteResult`. By exporting these types, other parts of the project can use them to ensure consistency and compatibility with the nbformat schema.\n\nHere's an example of how these exported types could be used in another file in the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Cell, DisplayData } from 'weave';\n\nfunction displayCellOutput(cell: Cell) {\n  if (cell.cell_type === 'code' && cell.outputs) {\n    cell.outputs.forEach(output => {\n      if (output.output_type === 'display_data') {\n        const displayData = output as DisplayData;\n        // do something with the display data\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Cell` and `DisplayData` types are imported from the weave module and used to type check the input to the `displayCellOutput` function. This helps ensure that the function is only called with valid cell objects and display data outputs.\n\nThe `schemas` subfolder contains the `nbformat.v4.schema.json` file, which defines a JSON schema for Jupyter Notebook version 4.5. This schema is organized into several sections, including root-level properties, cell definitions, output definitions, and miscellaneous definitions. In the larger project, this schema plays a vital role in validating Jupyter Notebook files, ensuring that they adhere to the expected format and structure. This validation process helps maintain consistency and compatibility across different parts of the project that interact with Jupyter Notebook files.",

      "summary": "The `types` folder in the `weave-js` project contains various TypeScript interfaces and types that are used throughout the application to enforce type safety and make it easier to work with complex data structures. These types are organized into several files, each focusing on a specific aspect of the project.\n\nIn `base.ts`, a set of generic type helpers is provided, which can be used to manipulate and enforce type safety for complex types. For example, the `Omit` helper can be used to create a new type with a specific key removed:\n\n```typescript\ntype Person = { name: string; age: number; };\ntype NamelessPerson = Omit<Person, 'name'>; // { age: number; }\n```\n\nThe `graphql.ts` file defines the `Tag` interface, which represents a tag object used for categorizing or organizing items. This interface can be used to ensure consistency when working with tags throughout the application:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Tag } from 'weave';\n\nconst myTag: Tag = {\n  name: 'My Tag',\n  colorIndex: 2,\n  icon: 'tag',\n};\n```\n\nThe `json.ts` file provides interfaces and types for working with JSON objects and values in a type-safe manner. For example, a `JSONObject` can be defined and manipulated using these types:\n\n```typescript\nconst myObj: JSONObject = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  hobbies: [\"reading\", \"writing\", \"coding\"]\n};\n```\n\nIn `media.ts`, various interfaces and types related to media metadata are defined, such as `ImageMetadata`, `AudioMetadata`, and `TableMetadata`. These types can be used to enforce consistency when working with media files in the application.\n\nThe `libs` subfolder contains additional types and utilities for specific libraries used in the project. For example, the `nglviewer.ts` file defines the `RepresentationType` type and `RepresentationTypeValues` array for representing molecular structures in a 3D graphics program. These types can be used to provide a list of options for users to choose from when selecting a representation type for a molecular structure.\n\nThe `ipynb` folder contains types related to the nbformat schema used in the project for validating Jupyter Notebook files. The exported types, such as `NbformatSchema`, `Cell`, and `DisplayData`, can be used to ensure consistency and compatibility with the nbformat schema when working with Jupyter Notebook files:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Cell, DisplayData } from 'weave';\n\nfunction displayCellOutput(cell: Cell) {\n  if (cell.cell_type === 'code' && cell.outputs) {\n    cell.outputs.forEach(output => {\n      if (output.output_type === 'display_data') {\n        const displayData = output as DisplayData;\n        // do something with the display data\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, the `types` folder provides a collection of interfaces and types that help maintain type safety and consistency throughout the `weave-js` project. These types can be used in various parts of the application to ensure that data structures are properly formatted and compatible with the expected formats and structures.",

  "summary": "The `common` folder in the `weave-js` project contains various files and subfolders that provide essential functionality, styling, and state management for the application. These components work together to ensure a consistent and efficient user experience throughout the project.\n\nFor instance, the `index.css` file sets up global CSS variables and basic styles for the entire page, making it easier to maintain a consistent visual style. An example usage of the global CSS variables is:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--primaryColor);\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThe `assets` subfolder provides a custom font and various icon classes, as well as a spinner animation, that can be used throughout the project to enhance the user interface and improve the user experience. To use the \"drag-handle\" icon, one would simply add the class \"icon-drag-handle\" to an HTML element:\n\n```html\n<button class=\"icon-drag-handle\">Drag</button>\n```\n\nThe `containers` subfolder contains the container components that manage the state and logic of the application. The main `App` container component serves as the root component for the entire application, while other container components manage specific parts of the application. For example, a `UserContainer` component might be responsible for fetching user data and passing it down to a `UserList` presentational component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { fetchUsers } from '../actions/userActions';\nimport UserList from '../components/UserList';\n\nclass UserContainer extends Component {\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.props.fetchUsers();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return <UserList users={this.props.users} />;\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = state => ({\n  users: state.users\n});\n\nconst mapDispatchToProps = {\n  fetchUsers\n};\n\nexport default connect(\n  mapStateToProps,\n  mapDispatchToProps\n)(UserContainer);\n```\n\nThe `css` subfolder contains various Less and CSS files that define the styling for different components and elements in the project. These files ensure a consistent look and feel across the project by providing reusable styles and mixins. For example, the `DragDrop.less` file defines the `.drag-drop-handle` class, which changes the cursor to a hand icon when hovering over an element, indicating that it can be dragged and dropped:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"drag-drop-handle\">\n  Drag me!\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `hooks` subfolder provides a custom React hook called `useLifecycleProfiling` that helps developers track the duration a component is mounted in a React application. This can be useful for identifying performance issues and monitoring the performance of different components:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useLifecycleProfiling } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  useLifecycleProfiling('my-component', (data) => {\n    console.log(data);\n  });\n\n  return <div>Hello World</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThe `state` folder contains custom React hooks and utility functions that enhance the functionality and performance of the project. These hooks and functions can be used in conjunction with other components and modules within the project to create a more efficient and robust user experience.\n\nFinally, the `types` folder provides a collection of interfaces and types that help maintain type safety and consistency throughout the `weave-js` project. These types can be used in various parts of the application to ensure that data structures are properly formatted and compatible with the expected formats and structures.",
