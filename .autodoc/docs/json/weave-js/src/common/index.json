  "summary": "This code defines various font faces and sets some global CSS variables. The `@font-face` rules define custom fonts for use in the project. The `graphein` font family is defined with different weights and styles, while the `panel-icons` font family is defined with multiple formats for cross-browser compatibility. \n\nThe `body` selector sets some basic styles for the entire page, including setting the font family to `graphein`. The `:root` selector sets global CSS variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables define various colors that can be used consistently across the project, making it easier to maintain a consistent visual style.\n\nOverall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project, as it sets up some basic styles and fonts that will be used throughout the site. Here is an example of how the global CSS variables could be used in other parts of the project:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--primaryColor);\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThis code defines a `.button` class that uses the `--primaryColor` variable for the background color. This ensures that all buttons on the site will have a consistent color, and makes it easy to change the color site-wide by simply updating the `--primaryColor` variable in one place.",
