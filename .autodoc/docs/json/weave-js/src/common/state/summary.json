      "summary": "The `weave` project includes a file with several custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to be used in conjunction with other components to provide additional functionality.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook is a generic hook that takes a value and returns the previous value. This is useful for tracking changes in state over time. The hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to store the previous value and update it when the value changes.\n\nThe `useDeepMemo` hook is another generic hook that takes a value and an optional equality function. The hook only returns a new value if the value has changed by deep comparison from one call to the next. This is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. The hook uses the `useRef` and `usePrevious` hooks to store the previous value and compare it to the current value.\n\nThe `useGatedValue` hook takes a value and an update function and returns a gated value. The gated value is only updated if the value has changed and the update function returns true. This is useful for filtering out unwanted updates and optimizing performance. The hook uses the `useRef` hook to store the current value and compare it to the new value.\n\nThe `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook takes a value and a debounce time and returns a ref and a boolean. The hook returns true when the ref becomes on screen for the first time after some time period and stays true until the value changes. This is useful for scrolling loading. The hook uses the `useInView`, `usePrevious`, and `useState` hooks to track the state of the component and update it when necessary.\n\nOverall, these hooks provide additional functionality to the `weave` project by optimizing performance, tracking state changes, and providing additional functionality for scrolling loading. These hooks can be used in conjunction with other components to provide a more robust and efficient user experience.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useDeepMemo` hook?\n- The `useDeepMemo` hook returns a memoized value only if the value changes by deep-comparison from one call to the next.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useGatedValue` hook?\n- The `useGatedValue` hook returns the current value if it is different from the previous value and satisfies the condition specified by the `updateWhen` function.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook?\n- The `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook returns true when the `domRef` becomes on screen for the first time after some time period, and stays true until the `value` changes. It is useful for scrolling loading."

          "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `File` which represents a file object in the larger project called `weave`. The `File` interface has several properties that describe the file, including its `id`, `name`, `url`, `sizeBytes`, and `updatedAt`. \n\nThe `id` property is a unique identifier for the file, while the `name` property is the name of the file. The `url` property is an optional string that represents the URL where the file can be accessed. The `sizeBytes` property is a number that represents the size of the file in bytes. The `updatedAt` property is an optional date that represents the last time the file was updated.\n\nIn addition to these properties, the `File` interface also has several optional properties that are specific to different types of files. For example, the `ref` property is used for `ArtifactFiles` and represents a reference to the file. The `digest` property is also used for `ArtifactFiles` and represents the digest of the file. The `selected` and `disabled` properties are used to indicate whether the file is selected or disabled. The `artifact` property is used to store information about the artifact that the file belongs to. Finally, the `storagePolicyConfig` property is used to store information about the storage policy for the file.\n\nOverall, the `File` interface is an important part of the `weave` project as it provides a standardized way to represent files in the system. This interface can be used by other parts of the project to create, update, and delete files. For example, a function that creates a new file might look like this:\n\n```\nfunction createFile(name: string, sizeBytes: number): File {\n  const id = generateUniqueId();\n  const file: File = {\n    id,\n    name,\n    sizeBytes,\n    updatedAt: new Date(),\n  };\n  return file;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `createFile` function takes a `name` and `sizeBytes` parameter and returns a new `File` object with a unique `id`, the provided `name` and `sizeBytes`, and the current date as the `updatedAt` property. This function can be used by other parts of the `weave` project to create new files.",
          "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `File` interface?\n   The `File` interface defines the properties and types for a file object, including its ID, name, size, and optional URL and timestamps.\n\n2. What is the difference between `updatedAt` for `Run files` and `ArtifactFiles`?\n   `Run files` always pass `updatedAt`, while `ArtifactFiles` never do. This is because individual file timestamps are not very useful for artifacts.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `storagePolicyConfig` property?\n   The `storagePolicyConfig` property is an optional object that can contain information about the storage region and layout for the file."
