  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a file with several custom React hooks. These hooks are designed to be used in conjunction with other components to provide additional functionality.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook is a generic hook that takes a value and returns the previous value. This is useful for tracking changes in state over time. The hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to store the previous value and update it when the value changes.\n\nThe `useDeepMemo` hook is another generic hook that takes a value and an optional equality function. The hook only returns a new value if the value has changed by deep comparison from one call to the next. This is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. The hook uses the `useRef` and `usePrevious` hooks to store the previous value and compare it to the current value.\n\nThe `useGatedValue` hook takes a value and an update function and returns a gated value. The gated value is only updated if the value has changed and the update function returns true. This is useful for filtering out unwanted updates and optimizing performance. The hook uses the `useRef` hook to store the current value and compare it to the new value.\n\nThe `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook takes a value and a debounce time and returns a ref and a boolean. The hook returns true when the ref becomes on screen for the first time after some time period and stays true until the value changes. This is useful for scrolling loading. The hook uses the `useInView`, `usePrevious`, and `useState` hooks to track the state of the component and update it when necessary.\n\nOverall, these hooks provide additional functionality to the `weave` project by optimizing performance, tracking state changes, and providing additional functionality for scrolling loading. These hooks can be used in conjunction with other components to provide a more robust and efficient user experience.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useDeepMemo` hook?\n- The `useDeepMemo` hook returns a memoized value only if the value changes by deep-comparison from one call to the next.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useGatedValue` hook?\n- The `useGatedValue` hook returns the current value if it is different from the previous value and satisfies the condition specified by the `updateWhen` function.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook?\n- The `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook returns true when the `domRef` becomes on screen for the first time after some time period, and stays true until the `value` changes. It is useful for scrolling loading."
