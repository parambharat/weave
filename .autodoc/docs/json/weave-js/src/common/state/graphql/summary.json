      "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `File` which represents a file object in the larger project called `weave`. The `File` interface has several properties that describe the file, including its `id`, `name`, `url`, `sizeBytes`, and `updatedAt`. \n\nThe `id` property is a unique identifier for the file, while the `name` property is the name of the file. The `url` property is an optional string that represents the URL where the file can be accessed. The `sizeBytes` property is a number that represents the size of the file in bytes. The `updatedAt` property is an optional date that represents the last time the file was updated.\n\nIn addition to these properties, the `File` interface also has several optional properties that are specific to different types of files. For example, the `ref` property is used for `ArtifactFiles` and represents a reference to the file. The `digest` property is also used for `ArtifactFiles` and represents the digest of the file. The `selected` and `disabled` properties are used to indicate whether the file is selected or disabled. The `artifact` property is used to store information about the artifact that the file belongs to. Finally, the `storagePolicyConfig` property is used to store information about the storage policy for the file.\n\nOverall, the `File` interface is an important part of the `weave` project as it provides a standardized way to represent files in the system. This interface can be used by other parts of the project to create, update, and delete files. For example, a function that creates a new file might look like this:\n\n```\nfunction createFile(name: string, sizeBytes: number): File {\n  const id = generateUniqueId();\n  const file: File = {\n    id,\n    name,\n    sizeBytes,\n    updatedAt: new Date(),\n  };\n  return file;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `createFile` function takes a `name` and `sizeBytes` parameter and returns a new `File` object with a unique `id`, the provided `name` and `sizeBytes`, and the current date as the `updatedAt` property. This function can be used by other parts of the `weave` project to create new files.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `File` interface?\n   The `File` interface defines the properties and types for a file object, including its ID, name, size, and optional URL and timestamps.\n\n2. What is the difference between `updatedAt` for `Run files` and `ArtifactFiles`?\n   `Run files` always pass `updatedAt`, while `ArtifactFiles` never do. This is because individual file timestamps are not very useful for artifacts.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `storagePolicyConfig` property?\n   The `storagePolicyConfig` property is an optional object that can contain information about the storage region and layout for the file."

  "summary": "The `runFilesQuery.ts` file in the `weave-js/src/common/state/graphql` folder is responsible for defining the `File` interface, which is a crucial component in the `weave` project. The `File` interface standardizes the representation of files within the system, allowing other parts of the project to interact with files in a consistent manner.\n\nThe `File` interface includes several properties that describe a file:\n\n- `id`: A unique identifier for the file.\n- `name`: The name of the file.\n- `url` (optional): The URL where the file can be accessed.\n- `sizeBytes`: The size of the file in bytes.\n- `updatedAt` (optional): The last time the file was updated.\n\nAdditionally, the `File` interface has optional properties specific to different file types:\n\n- `ref`: A reference to the file, used for `ArtifactFiles`.\n- `digest`: The digest of the file, used for `ArtifactFiles`.\n- `selected`: Indicates whether the file is selected.\n- `disabled`: Indicates whether the file is disabled.\n- `artifact`: Information about the artifact the file belongs to.\n- `storagePolicyConfig`: Information about the storage policy for the file.\n\nThe `File` interface can be utilized by other parts of the project to create, update, and delete files.

This interface allows for consistent interaction with files across the project, enabling the creation, updating, and deletion of files through functions like the `createFile` example provided.",
