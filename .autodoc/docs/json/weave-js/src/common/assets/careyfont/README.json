  "summary": "The code in this file provides information about the font used in the Weave project. It is generated by the open-source project Fontello and includes various font formats, CSS files, a demo file, a license file, and a configuration file. The purpose of this code is to provide guidance on how to use the font in a project and how to comply with the original font licenses. \n\nThe CSS files included in the archive provide different options for using the font, depending on the needs of the project. The basic CSS file contains @font-face and character code definitions, while other files provide support for IE7, custom @font-face rules, and embedded WOFF fonts to avoid CORS issues. The animate.css file can be used to get ideas about spinner rotation animation.\n\nThe code also includes instructions for server setup to ensure that the font files are served with the proper MIME types. Apache is already set up with the necessary settings, but other web servers like Nginx need to be tuned. The MIME types for the file extensions used in this project are listed in the code.\n\nOverall, this code provides important information for developers who want to use the Weave font in their projects. It explains how to comply with the original font licenses, provides different CSS options for using the font, and gives guidance on server setup to ensure that the font files are served correctly.",
