  "summary": "The `weave` project contains a module that handles cookies. The module exports several functions that allow for the manipulation of cookies in the browser. \n\nThe `getCookie` function takes a cookie name as an argument and returns the value of the cookie with that name. It does this by first calling the `getCookieStrs` function, which retrieves all the cookies as an array of strings. It then iterates over each string, converting it to a key-value pair using the `cookieStrToKeyVal` function. If the key matches the cookie name, the function returns the value. If no match is found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe `getCookieBool` function is similar to `getCookie`, but it returns a boolean value indicating whether a cookie with the given name exists or not.\n\nThe `getAllCookies` function returns an object containing all the cookies on the current domain. It does this by iterating over each cookie string, converting it to a key-value pair, and adding it to an object. If a key already exists in the object, the value is converted to an array and the new value is pushed onto it.\n\nThe `setCookie` function sets a cookie with the given key-value pair. It takes an optional `expires` parameter, which is a `Date` object representing the expiration date of the cookie. If no expiration date is provided, the cookie will expire at the end of the session. The `unsetCookie` function removes a cookie with the given key.\n\nThe `getFirebaseCookie` function retrieves a cookie with the given key from Firebase. It does this by calling the `getCookie` function with the key `__session`, which returns a JSON string containing all the Firebase cookies. The function then parses this string and returns the value of the cookie with the given key.\n\nOverall, this module provides a simple interface for working with cookies in the browser. It can be used to retrieve, set, and remove cookies, as well as to retrieve Firebase cookies. Here is an example of how to use the `setCookie` function:\n\n```\nsetCookie('username', 'johndoe', new Date('2022-01-01'));\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- The code provided is only a small part of the `weave` project, so it is unclear what the overall purpose of the project is.\n\n2. What is the `types` module and what does it contain?\n- The code imports the `isTruthy` and `Struct` functions from a module called `types`, but it is unclear what this module contains or what its purpose is.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `setCookie` and `unsetCookie` functions?\n- The code provides functions for setting and unsetting cookies, but it is unclear what the purpose of these functions is or how they are used within the `weave` project."
