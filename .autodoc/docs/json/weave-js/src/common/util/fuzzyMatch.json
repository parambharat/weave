  "summary": "The `weave` project includes a module with commonly used functions for fuzzy searching and highlighting search results. The module exports several functions that can be used to perform fuzzy matching, score matches, and highlight matching substrings. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchRegex` function takes a string and returns a regular expression that matches the string in a fuzzy way. The function iterates over each character in the input string and escapes any special characters before adding a `.*` to match any number of characters between the input characters. The resulting regular expression matches any string that contains all the characters of the input string in the same order. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchScore` function takes two strings and returns a score indicating how well the second string matches the first. The function uses the `longestCommonSubstring` function to find the longest common substring between the two strings and returns its length. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` function takes an array of objects, a search string, and a function that returns a string for each object. The function filters the objects that match the search string using the `fuzzyMatchRegex` function and scores them using the `fuzzyMatchScore` function. The function returns the objects sorted by their score and calls the `preferExactMatch` function to move exact matches to the top of the list. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatch` function is a wrapper around `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` that takes an array of strings instead of objects and returns an array of matching strings. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchSplit` function takes a string and a search string and returns an array of substrings that alternate between matching and non-matching substrings. The function uses a case-insensitive search to find the first occurrence of the search string in the input string and splits the input string into pieces accordingly. \n\nThe `fuzzyComponentSplit` function takes a tuple of two strings and a search string and returns two arrays of substrings that alternate between matching and non-matching substrings. The function concatenates the two input strings and calls `fuzzyMatchSplit` to split the resulting string. The function then splits the resulting array into two arrays based on the length of the substrings that come from the first input string. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchHighlightPieces` function takes an array of substrings and a style object and returns a React fragment that highlights the matching substrings using the style object. The function iterates over the substrings and wraps the matching substrings in a `span` element with the given style. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchHighlight` function takes a string, a search string, and a style object and returns a React fragment that highlights the earliest matching subsequence in the string using the style object. The function calls `fuzzyMatchSplit` to split the input string and `fuzzyMatchHighlightPieces` to highlight the matching substrings. \n\nThe `preferExactMatch` function takes an array of objects, a search string, and a function that returns a string for each object. The function sorts the objects based on whether their string representation matches the search string exactly and returns the sorted array. \n\nOverall, this module provides a set of functions that can be used to perform fuzzy searching and highlighting in a variety of contexts. The functions can be used to implement search functionality in a web application or to perform fuzzy matching in a data processing pipeline.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fuzzyMatchRegex` function?\n   \n   The `fuzzyMatchRegex` function takes a string and returns a regular expression that can be used to perform fuzzy matching on other strings. The regular expression matches all the letters from the query in the same order but might have other characters interspersed among them.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` function?\n   \n   The `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` function takes an array of objects, a string, and a function that returns a string for each object. It returns an array of objects that match the fuzzy search query. The objects are sorted by their similarity score to the query, with the most similar objects first.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `fuzzyMatchHighlight` function?\n   \n   The `fuzzyMatchHighlight` function takes a string, a query string, and an optional style object. It returns a React fragment that highlights the earliest matching subsequence of the string with the given style."
