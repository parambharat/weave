  "summary": "The `weave` module provides a set of functions for working with JavaScript data structures, similar to what the popular `lodash` library provides. The module exports several functions that can be used in a larger project to perform various operations on data structures.\n\nThe `difference` function takes two objects and returns a new object that represents the difference between them. It uses the `_.transform` function from `lodash` to recursively compare the two objects and return the differences. This function can be used to compare two objects and determine what has changed between them.\n\nThe `randID` function generates a random string of characters of a specified length. It uses a set of characters to generate the string and returns the result. This function can be used to generate unique IDs for various purposes in a larger project.\n\nThe `sampleSorted` function takes an array and a number `n` and returns a new array that contains `n` elements from the original array, evenly distributed but always including the first and last elements. This function can be used to sample a sorted array and get a representative subset of its elements.\n\nThe `expandRangeToNElements` function takes a range and a sorted collection of numbers and expands the range to the closest range that captures a number of elements in the collection equal to `n`. This function can be used to expand a range of numbers to include a certain number of elements from a sorted collection.\n\nThe `Group` and `GroupedList` types and related functions are useful for dealing with grouped data in conjunction with singular items, a common pattern in UIs. The `firstGrouped` function returns the first item in a `GroupedList`, or the first item in the first group if the first item is a group. The `mapGroupedLeafs` function loops through all the items in a `GroupedList` and executes a given function on each item and each sub-item if it's a group. \n\nThe `nestedKeyPaths` function takes a nested object and returns an array of all the key paths in the object. This function can be used to get all the key paths in a nested object.\n\nThe `move` function takes an array, a `from` index, and a `to` index, and moves the element at the `from` index to the `to` index. This function can be used to move elements in an array.\n\nThe `repeatMany` function takes an array and a number `n` and returns a new array that contains `n` copies of the original array. This function can be used to repeat an array multiple times.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `difference` function?\n- The `difference` function is used to find the difference between two objects using lodash. It takes two objects as arguments and returns a new object that represents the difference between them.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `expandRangeToNElements` function?\n- The `expandRangeToNElements` function takes a range and a collection as arguments and expands the range to the closest range that captures a number of elements in the collection equal to size. It returns a new range that includes the original range and additional elements from the collection.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `nestedKeyPaths` function?\n- The `nestedKeyPaths` function takes a nested map as an argument and returns an array of all the key paths in the map. It can be used to traverse a nested map and perform operations on all the leaf nodes."
