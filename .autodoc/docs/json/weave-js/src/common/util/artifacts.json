  "summary": "This file contains a set of utility functions and interfaces related to artifacts and their labels. \n\nThe `ArtifactLabels` interface defines a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is an array of strings. This interface is used to represent the labels of an artifact.\n\nThe `Label` interface defines an object with two properties: `key` and `val`, both of which are strings. This interface is used to represent a single label.\n\nThe `parseArtifactTypeDescription` function takes a string as input and returns an object with two properties: `description` and `schema`. The input string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the `description` property. The remaining lines are joined together to form the `schema` property. If the input string is null or empty, both properties are set to undefined.\n\nThe `createArtifactTypeDescription` function takes a `description` string and an optional `schema` string as input and returns a string. The `description` string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the first line of the output string. If the `schema` string is not null, it is appended to the output string with a newline character.\n\nThe `parseArtifactLabels` function takes a string as input and returns an object of type `ArtifactLabels`. The input string is expected to be a JSON-encoded string. If the input string is not valid JSON, an empty object is returned.\n\nThe `parseLabelString` function takes a string of the form \"key:value\" as input and returns an object of type `Label`. If the input string is not in the expected format, the `key` and `val` properties of the returned object are set to empty strings.\n\nThe `newLabelValid` function takes a `Label` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `key` property has a length greater than 2 and the `val` property is not empty.\n\nThe `newAliasValid` function takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is not empty.\n\nThe `artifactNiceName` function takes an artifact object and an optional options object as input and returns a string. The output string is of the form \"artifactSequence.name:digest\" or \"artifactSequence.name:commitHash\" if `versionIndex` is null. If `versionIndex` is not null, the output string is of the form \"artifactSequence.name:vversionIndex\". If `shortenDigest` is true, the `digest` property is shortened to the first 6 characters.\n\nThe `artifactMembershipNiceName` function takes a `collectionName` string and an identifier object as input and returns a string of the form \"collectionName:alias\". The `alias` property is determined based on the properties of the input identifier object.\n\nThe `isVersionAlias` function takes an object with an `alias` property as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` property is of the form \"vX\", where X is a positive integer.\n\nThe `getDescriptionSummary` function takes an artifact description string as input and returns the first line of the string.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ArtifactLabels` and `Label` interfaces?\n- The `ArtifactLabels` interface defines a dictionary object where the keys are strings and the values are arrays of strings. The `Label` interface defines an object with `key` and `val` properties, both of which are strings.\n\n2. What do the `parseArtifactTypeDescription` and `createArtifactTypeDescription` functions do?\n- `parseArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a string and returns an object with `description` and `schema` properties. If the input string is null or empty, the function returns default values. `createArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a `description` string and an optional `schema` string, and returns a concatenated string with a newline character between the two.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isVersionAlias` function?\n- The `isVersionAlias` function takes in an object with an `alias` property and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` matches a specific regular expression pattern (`/^v(\\d+)$/`). This is used to determine if the alias represents a version number."
