  "summary": "The `weave` module contains utility functions and constants related to time and date manipulation. The module exports several constants, including the number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years in their respective units. It also exports functions for converting between different time units, such as `secondsToHours` and `millisecondsToDays`. \n\nThe `TimeDelta` class represents a duration of time in seconds and provides methods for converting the duration to a string representation. The `toSingleUnitString` method returns an approximate string representation of the duration using the largest unit that has a non-zero value. The `toHoursString` method returns the duration in hours with two decimal places. The `toDHMSString` method returns the duration in the format \"Ddays HH:mm:ss\". \n\nThe `monthRoundedTime` function takes a duration in seconds and returns a string representation of the duration in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The largest unit in this timestamp is months. \n\nThe `formatDurationWithColons` and `formatDurationWithLetters` functions take a duration in seconds and return a string representation of the duration in the format \"XX:XX:XX:XX\" and \"Xd Xh Xm Xs\", respectively. \n\nThe module also exports several utility functions for working with dates and times. The `unixTimestampMSFromUTCString` function takes a UTC date string and returns the corresponding Unix timestamp in milliseconds. The `DateFromUTCString` function takes a UTC date string or a `Date` object and returns a `Date` object adjusted to the local time zone. The `addUTCTimezoneIfNotPresent` function adds a \"Z\" postfix to a UTC date string if it is not already present. The `addDays` function adds a specified number of days to a `Date` object. The `diffInMilliseconds` and `diffInDays` functions calculate the difference between two `Date` objects in milliseconds and days, respectively. \n\nFinally, the `getTimeSegmentsInTimeZone` function takes a time zone string and returns an object containing the current hour, minute, and second in that time zone. \n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides a comprehensive set of utility functions and constants for working with dates and times in JavaScript. These functions can be used in a variety of applications, such as calculating durations, formatting timestamps, and working with time zones.",
  "questions": "1. What are the units used in the `monthRoundedTime` function and how are they calculated?\n- The function uses convenient units in seconds for minute, hour, day, and month.\n- The values for these units are calculated by multiplying the number of seconds in a minute, hour, day, and month by their respective units.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `TimeDelta` class and its methods?\n- The `TimeDelta` class represents a duration of time in seconds and provides methods to convert it to a string representation in various formats.\n- The `toSingleUnitString` method returns an approximate string using the largest unit that would have a non-zero value.\n- The `toHoursString` method returns the duration in hours with two decimal places.\n- The `toDHMSString` method returns the duration in the format Ddays HH:mm:ss.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getTimeSegmentsInTimeZone` function and how does it work?\n- The function returns an object with the current hour, minute, and second in the specified time zone.\n- It uses the `toLocaleTimeString` method with the specified time zone and options to format the current time in the desired format and then extracts the hour, minute, and second from the resulting string."
