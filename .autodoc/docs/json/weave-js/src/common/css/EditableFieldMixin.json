  "summary": "The code above defines a mixin called `editable-field-mixin` that can be used to style editable fields in a consistent way across the project. The mixin takes several parameters that can be customized, such as the size and color of the icon, the font size and color of the label and field, and the placeholder color.\n\nThe mixin uses flexbox to align the icon, label, and field content vertically. The icon is a font icon that is styled with the specified size and color, and is positioned to the left of the label. The label is styled with the specified font size, color, and text transform, and is given a fixed width. The field content is styled with the specified font size, color, opacity, and line height, and is given padding and a border radius to create a rounded rectangle. If the field content is empty, a placeholder text with the specified color is displayed.\n\nWhen the editable field is not read-only, hovering over it changes the background color of the field content to a light gray and changes the cursor to a pointer. If the editable field is a URL field, a \"http://\" prefix is displayed before the input field, and a \"go to link\" icon is displayed to the right of the input field.\n\nThe `editable-field-mixin` can be used in other files in the `weave` project to style editable fields consistently. For example, if a form in the project has several editable fields, the `editable-field-mixin` can be applied to each field to ensure that they all have the same styling. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n.editable-field {\n  @import './editable-field.less';\n  .editable-field-mixin();\n}\n```",
