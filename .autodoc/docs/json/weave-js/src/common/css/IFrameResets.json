  "summary": "This code is responsible for styling the UI of the weave project. It contains CSS classes that define the layout and appearance of various elements on the page. \n\nThe first class, `.main`, sets the top margin of an iframe element to the height of the search navigation bar. This ensures that the iframe content is positioned correctly on the page. \n\nThe second class, `.hide-in-iframe`, hides an element when it is displayed within an iframe. This is useful for elements that are not needed in the embedded view, such as a header or footer. \n\nThe third class, `.show-in-frame`, hides an element when it is displayed outside of an iframe. This is useful for elements that are only needed in the full view, such as a navigation bar. \n\nThe fourth class, `.show-in-iframe`, displays an element when it is displayed within an iframe. This is the opposite of the `.hide-in-iframe` class and is useful for elements that are only needed in the embedded view. \n\nThe fifth class, `.report-header-view__content`, sets the top margin of an element to 0. This is used to remove any unwanted spacing at the top of the report header. \n\nThe sixth class, `.search-nav`, sets the position of the search navigation bar to fixed and adds a white background with a box shadow. This ensures that the navigation bar is always visible and stands out from the rest of the page. \n\nThe final class, `.night-mode.iframe`, changes the background color of the search navigation bar to a dark gray when the page is in night mode. It also changes the color of the h1 element to white to improve visibility. \n\nOverall, this code is essential for ensuring that the UI of the weave project is consistent and visually appealing. It allows for elements to be hidden or displayed depending on the context in which they are viewed, and it ensures that important elements such as the search navigation bar are always visible. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo hide an element in an iframe, add the `.hide-in-iframe` class to the element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"hide-in-iframe\">This element will be hidden in an iframe</div>\n```\n\nTo display an element only in an iframe, add the `.show-in-iframe` class to the element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"show-in-iframe\">This element will only be displayed in an iframe</div>\n```",
