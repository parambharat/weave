  "summary": "This file contains global variables for the Weave project's styling. It defines colors, font sizes, spacing, and other visual properties that are used throughout the project. \n\nThe file starts with a comment noting that it needs to be kept in sync with another file. It then defines a set of grayscale colors, followed by a set of theme colors, including primary, success, warning, and error colors. \n\nThe file also defines extended colors and privacy badge colors, as well as box shadows and font sizes. It includes functional color rules for action buttons and separators, and defines mixins for setting text color and creating single-line text with ellipsis overflow. \n\nThese global variables can be used in other files throughout the project to ensure consistency in styling. For example, a button component might use the `@primary` color for its background, and the `@primaryText` color for its font color. \n\nOverall, this file serves as a central location for defining the visual properties of the Weave project, making it easier to maintain consistency and make changes across the project.",
