  "summary": "This code defines font styles for the Source Sans Pro font family in various weights and styles. The `@font-face` rule is used to specify the font family, style, weight, and source of the font files. The `src` property specifies the location of the font files in different formats, such as WOFF and WOFF2, which are supported by different browsers. \n\nThis code is used to ensure that the Source Sans Pro font family is available and displayed correctly on the website or application that uses it. By defining the font styles in this way, the website or application can reference the font family in its CSS and apply the desired font weight and style to different elements. For example, the following CSS rule could be used to apply the regular weight of the Source Sans Pro font to all paragraphs on a website:\n\n```\np {\n  font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\nThis code is part of the larger weave project, which likely includes other CSS and HTML files that reference the Source Sans Pro font family and apply it to different elements. By defining the font styles in a separate file, the project can ensure consistency in the appearance of text across different pages and sections of the website or application.",
