      "summary": "The `DragDrop.less` file is a part of the `weave` project and contains styling rules for drag and drop functionality. The purpose of this code is to provide a visual cue to the user that an element can be dragged and dropped. \n\nThe code imports the `globals.less` file, which likely contains global styling rules for the entire project. The `.drag-drop-handle` class is defined with a `cursor` property set to `grab`, which changes the cursor to a hand icon when the user hovers over an element with this class. When the user clicks and holds the element, the `:active` pseudo-class is applied, changing the cursor to a grabbing icon. This provides a visual cue to the user that the element is being dragged.\n\nThis code can be used in conjunction with JavaScript code that handles the actual drag and drop functionality. For example, a developer could use this code to style a draggable element with the `.drag-drop-handle` class and then use JavaScript to handle the drag and drop events. \n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in a larger project:\n\nHTML:\n```\n<div class=\"drag-drop-handle\">\n  Drag me!\n</div>\n```\n\nCSS:\n```\n@import './DragDrop.less';\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n```\nconst draggable = document.querySelector('.drag-drop-handle');\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag start event\n});\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragend', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag end event\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `DragDrop.less` file is imported into the project's main CSS file. The `.drag-drop-handle` class is applied to a `div` element in the HTML, which is then selected in JavaScript and given event listeners for the `dragstart` and `dragend` events. When the user clicks and holds the element, the cursor changes to a grabbing icon, indicating that the element is being dragged.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines the styling for a drag and drop handle in the Weave project.\n\n2. What other files does this code depend on?\n   This code imports the `globals.less` file, so it likely depends on variables and mixins defined in that file.\n\n3. Are there any browser compatibility concerns with this code?\n   The use of the `grab` and `grabbing` cursor values may not be supported in all browsers, so a smart developer may want to check for compatibility issues and provide fallback options if necessary."

This class uses the `editable-field-mixin()` mixin defined in `EditableFieldMixin.less`.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a reusable styling for an editable field component in the larger project. The `editable-field` class can be applied to any HTML element that needs to be editable, and it will inherit the styles defined in the `editable-field-mixin()` mixin. This mixin includes styles for displaying the field as a text input by default, but also includes styles for displaying the field as a textarea or a select input when it is in edit mode.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"editable-field\">\n  This text is editable.\n</div>\n```\n\nWhen this HTML is rendered, the text \"This text is editable.\" will be displayed with the styles defined in the `editable-field-mixin()` mixin.

      "summary": "The code above defines a mixin called `editable-field-mixin` that can be used to style editable fields in a consistent way across the project. The mixin takes several parameters that can be customized, such as the size and color of the icon, the font size and color of the label and field, and the placeholder color.\n\nThe mixin uses flexbox to align the icon, label, and field content vertically. The icon is a font icon that is styled with the specified size and color, and is positioned to the left of the label. The label is styled with the specified font size, color, and text transform, and is given a fixed width. The field content is styled with the specified font size, color, opacity, and line height, and is given padding and a border radius to create a rounded rectangle. If the field content is empty, a placeholder text with the specified color is displayed.\n\nWhen the editable field is not read-only, hovering over it changes the background color of the field content to a light gray and changes the cursor to a pointer. If the editable field is a URL field, a \"http://\" prefix is displayed before the input field, and a \"go to link\" icon is displayed to the right of the input field.\n\nThe `editable-field-mixin` can be used in other files in the `weave` project to style editable fields consistently. For example, if a form in the project has several editable fields, the `editable-field-mixin` can be applied to each field to ensure that they all have the same styling. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n.editable-field {\n  @import './editable-field.less';\n  .editable-field-mixin();\n}\n```",

      "summary": "This code is responsible for styling the UI of the weave project. It contains CSS classes that define the layout and appearance of various elements on the page. \n\nThe first class, `.main`, sets the top margin of an iframe element to the height of the search navigation bar. This ensures that the iframe content is positioned correctly on the page. \n\nThe second class, `.hide-in-iframe`, hides an element when it is displayed within an iframe. This is useful for elements that are not needed in the embedded view, such as a header or footer. \n\nThe third class, `.show-in-frame`, hides an element when it is displayed outside of an iframe. This is useful for elements that are only needed in the full view, such as a navigation bar. \n\nThe fourth class, `.show-in-iframe`, displays an element when it is displayed within an iframe. This is the opposite of the `.hide-in-iframe` class and is useful for elements that are only needed in the embedded view. \n\nThe fifth class, `.report-header-view__content`, sets the top margin of an element to 0. This is used to remove any unwanted spacing at the top of the report header. \n\nThe sixth class, `.search-nav`, sets the position of the search navigation bar to fixed and adds a white background with a box shadow. This ensures that the navigation bar is always visible and stands out from the rest of the page. \n\nThe final class, `.night-mode.iframe`, changes the background color of the search navigation bar to a dark gray when the page is in night mode. It also changes the color of the h1 element to white to improve visibility. \n\nOverall, this code is essential for ensuring that the UI of the weave project is consistent and visually appealing. It allows for elements to be hidden or displayed depending on the context in which they are viewed, and it ensures that important elements such as the search navigation bar are always visible. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo hide an element in an iframe, add the `.hide-in-iframe` class to the element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"hide-in-iframe\">This element will be hidden in an iframe</div>\n```\n\nTo display an element only in an iframe, add the `.show-in-iframe` class to the element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"show-in-iframe\">This element will only be displayed in an iframe</div>\n```",

The component consists of a container that holds both a stepper and an input field. The stepper allows the user to increment or decrement the value in the input field. \n\nThe `number-input` class is the main class for the component. It contains two child classes: `__container` and `__stepper`. The `__container` class sets the display property to flex, which allows the child elements to be aligned horizontally. The `__stepper` class also sets the display property to flex, but with a column direction. This allows the stepper buttons to be aligned vertically. The `justify-content` property centers the buttons vertically within the container. The `z-index` property sets the stacking order of the stepper buttons, and the `margin-left` property positions the stepper to the left of the input field. The `color` property sets the color of the stepper buttons to a gray color defined in the `globals.less` file.\n\nThe `__input` class sets the width of the input field to 10 times the value of `@spu`, which is a variable defined in the `globals.less` file. This ensures that the input field is wide enough to accommodate the largest possible value.\n\nThis code can be used to style a number input component in the Weave project. To use this component, the developer would need to add the appropriate HTML markup and apply the `number-input` class to the container element. For example:\n\n```\n<div class=\"number-input\">\n  <div class=\"number-input__container\">\n    <div class=\"number-input__stepper\">\n      <button>+</button>\n      <button>-</button>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"number\" class=\"number-input__input\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis would create a number input component with stepper buttons and an input field styled according to the code in this file.",

The animation starts at 0% and ends at 100%, with the element moving from its starting position to its final position over the course of the animation.\n\nThe second animation, `fade-in`, gradually increases the opacity of an element from 0 to 1. The animation starts at the `from` keyframe and ends at the `to` keyframe, with the element becoming more and more visible as the animation progresses.\n\nThe third animation, `fade-out`, does the opposite of `fade-in`. It gradually decreases the opacity of an element from 1 to 0, making it disappear. \n\nThe fourth animation, `blur-in`, gradually reduces the amount of blur applied to an element from 3 pixels to 0 pixels. This can be used to create a visual effect where an element gradually comes into focus.\n\nFinally, the `@popupAnimation` variable combines three of these animations (`slide-down`, `blur-in`, and `fade-in`) to create a single animation that can be applied to pop-up windows or other elements that need to appear on the screen.

This class can be used in conjunction with JavaScript code to handle drag and drop events:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"drag-drop-handle\">\n  Drag me!\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n@import './DragDrop.less';\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst draggable = document.querySelector('.drag-drop-handle');\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag start event\n});\n\ndraggable.addEventListener('dragend', (event) => {\n  // Code to handle drag end event\n});\n```\n\nThe `EditableField.less` file defines the `.editable-field` class, which uses the `editable-field-mixin()` mixin to style editable fields consistently across the project:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"editable-field\">\n  This text is editable.\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `IFrameResets.less` file provides classes to control the visibility and positioning of elements when displayed within an iframe:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"hide-in-iframe\">This element will be hidden in an iframe</div>\n<div class=\"show-in-iframe\">This element will only be displayed in an iframe</div>\n```\n\nThe `Markdown.less` file defines styling for markdown content, ensuring a consistent appearance across the project:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"markdown\">\n  <h1>My Markdown File</h1>\n  <p>This is some text in my markdown file.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `NumberInput.less` file provides styles for a number input component with stepper buttons:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"number-input\">\n  <div class=\"number-input__container\">\n    <div class=\"number-input__stepper\">\n      <button>+</button>\n      <button>-</button>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"number\" class=\"number-input__input\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe `animations.less` file defines several CSS animations that can be applied to elements for visual effects:\n\n```css\n.my-element {\n  animation: fade-in 1s;\n}\n```\n\nFinally, the `globals.less` file contains global variables for styling, ensuring consistency across the project. These variables can be used in other files to reference colors, font sizes, and other visual properties.\n\nIn summary, the code in this folder provides a collection of reusable styles and mixins for various components and elements in the Weave project. By using these files, developers can ensure a consistent look and feel across the project and easily maintain and update the styling as needed.",
