  "summary": "The `panel` folder in the `weave-js` project contains the source code for the panel component, which is a UI element that can be used to display and manage content in a structured and organized manner. This component can be used in various parts of the project where a panel-like interface is required.\n\n### Files\n\n1. **Panel.js**: This file contains the main implementation of the `Panel` class, which extends the base `Component` class. The `Panel` class provides methods for managing the panel's content, such as adding, removing, and updating items. It also handles user interactions, such as clicking on items or dragging and dropping them to reorder the list. The `Panel` class can be used as a standalone component or as a base class for more specialized panel components.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import Panel from './panel/Panel';\n\n   const myPanel = new Panel();\n   myPanel.addItem('Item 1');\n   myPanel.addItem('Item 2');\n   myPanel.on('itemClick', (item) => console.log('Clicked:', item));\n   ```\n\n2. **Panel.scss**: This file contains the SCSS styles for the `Panel` component. It defines the appearance of the panel, including the layout, colors, and typography. These styles can be customized to match the overall look and feel of the project.\n\n### Subfolders\n\n1. **components**: This subfolder contains additional components that can be used within the `Panel` component to create more complex and feature-rich panels. These components can be imported and used as needed in the project.\n\n   Example components:\n\n   - **Accordion**: A collapsible panel that can be used to display hierarchical content.\n   - **Tabs**: A tabbed panel that allows users to switch between different content views.\n   - **Toolbar**: A toolbar component that can be added to the top of a panel to provide additional functionality, such as buttons and search fields.\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import Panel from './panel/Panel';\n   import Accordion from './panel/components/Accordion';\n\n   const myPanel = new Panel();\n   const myAccordion = new Accordion();\n\n   myPanel.addItem(myAccordion);\n   myAccordion.addItem('Section 1', 'Content for section 1');\n   myAccordion.addItem('Section 2', 'Content for section 2');\n   ```\n\n2. **utils**: This subfolder contains utility functions and classes that are used internally by the `Panel` component and its subcomponents. These utilities help with tasks such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and data management.\n\n   Example utilities:\n\n   - **DragDropManager**: A class that handles drag-and-drop functionality for the panel items.\n   - **ItemStore**: A class that manages the storage and retrieval of panel items.\n\nIn summary, the `panel` folder in the `weave-js` project provides a versatile and customizable panel component that can be used to create organized and structured UI elements. The component can be extended with additional subcomponents and utilities to create more complex and feature-rich panels as needed.",
