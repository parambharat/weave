  "summary": "This file contains code that defines a context and hooks for managing and accessing the rendered configuration of a panel in a React application. \n\nThe `PanelRenderedConfigContext` is a context that provides a state object and a function to update that state object. The state object contains a `panelConfig` property that is an object with keys that are strings representing the path of a panel and values that are the rendered configuration of that panel. The `PanelRenderedConfigContextProvider` is a component that wraps its children with the `PanelRenderedConfigContext.Provider` and initializes the state object with an empty `panelConfig` object. \n\nThe `usePanelRenderedConfigByPath` hook takes a `path` argument, which is an array of strings representing the path of a panel, and returns the rendered configuration of that panel. It does this by accessing the `panelConfig` property of the state object in the `PanelRenderedConfigContext` and returning the value at the key that matches the `path` argument. \n\nThe `usePanelRenderedConfig` hook returns the rendered configuration of the panel that is currently in context. It does this by calling the `usePanelContext` hook, which returns an object with a `path` property representing the path of the panel. It then calls the `usePanelRenderedConfigByPath` hook with the `path` property as an argument. \n\nThe `useSetPanelRenderedConfigByPath` hook returns a function that takes a `path` argument and a `config` argument and updates the `panelConfig` property of the state object in the `PanelRenderedConfigContext` with the `config` argument at the key that matches the `path` argument. \n\nThe `useSetPanelRenderedConfig` hook takes a `config` argument and updates the rendered configuration of the panel that is currently in context. It does this by calling the `useSetPanelRenderedConfigByPath` hook to get the `setPanelRenderedConfig` function and the `usePanelContext` hook to get the `path` property. It then calls the `setPanelRenderedConfig` function with the `path` property and the `config` argument as arguments. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to manage and access the rendered configuration of panels in a React application. It does this by defining a context and hooks that allow components to access and update the rendered configuration of panels. This can be useful in larger projects where there are many panels with complex configurations that need to be managed and accessed in a standardized way. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// In a component that renders a panel\nimport { useSetPanelRenderedConfig } from './path/to/PanelRenderedConfigContext';\n\nconst MyPanel = () => {\n  const setPanelRenderedConfig = useSetPanelRenderedConfig();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const config = { /* some configuration */ };\n    setPanelRenderedConfig(config);\n  }, [setPanelRenderedConfig]);\n\n  return (\n    /* render panel */\n  );\n};\n```",
