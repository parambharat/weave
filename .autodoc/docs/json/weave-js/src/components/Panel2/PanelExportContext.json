  "summary": "This code defines a React context and provider component for managing a list of panels in the Weave project. The context is only active when the `weave-devpopup` beta feature is enabled in settings. \n\nThe `PanelExportUpdaterContext` is a context object that provides an `addPanel` method for adding a panel to the list. The `Updaters` interface defines the shape of the object that is passed to the context. It has a single method `addPanel` that takes a panel object as an argument and returns nothing.\n\nThe `PanelExportContextProvider` is a React functional component that wraps its children with the `PanelExportUpdaterContext.Provider`. It takes an optional `addPanel` prop that can be used to override the default `addPanel` method. If `addPanel` is not provided, a default implementation is used that logs a message to the console.\n\nThe `addPanel` method is memoized using the `useMemo` hook to avoid unnecessary re-renders. The `updaters` object is also memoized and passed as the value to the context provider.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Weave project to manage a list of panels that can be dynamically added or removed. Other components can consume the `PanelExportUpdaterContext` to add or remove panels from the list. For example:\n\n```\nimport {PanelExportUpdaterContext} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyPanel() {\n  const {addPanel} = useContext(PanelExportUpdaterContext);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const panel = {title: 'My Panel', content: 'Hello World!'};\n    addPanel(panel);\n    return () => {\n      // Remove panel when component unmounts\n      removePanel(panel);\n    };\n  }, [addPanel]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Panel</h1>\n      <p>Hello World!</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyPanel` component adds a panel to the list when it mounts and removes it when it unmounts. The `useContext` hook is used to get the `addPanel` method from the context.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelExportUpdaterContext` and `PanelExportContextProvider` components?\n- The `PanelExportUpdaterContext` component is a context that allows any panels inside to call an `addPanel` method provided by the `PanelExportContextProvider` component.\n \n2. What is the `Updaters` interface used for?\n- The `Updaters` interface defines the shape of an object that has an `addPanel` method that takes in a parameter of type `any` and returns `void`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?\n- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `addPanelUpdater` and `updaters` variables so that they are only recomputed when the `addPanel` prop changes."
