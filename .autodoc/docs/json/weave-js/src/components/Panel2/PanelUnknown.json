  "summary": "The code above is a TypeScript module that exports a React component called `PanelNumber` and a `PanelSpec` object. The `PanelNumber` component is a functional component that takes in a `PanelNumberProps` object as its props. The `PanelNumberProps` type is defined as a type alias of the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel` module, which takes in a generic type argument of `typeof inputType`. The `inputType` constant is defined as the string literal type `'unknown'` using the `as const` assertion.\n\nThe `PanelNumber` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to query the value of the `input` prop passed to it. If the `loading` property of the `nodeValueQuery` object returned by the hook is `true`, the component returns a `<div>` element with a dash (`-`) as its content. Otherwise, the component returns a `<div>` element with a `<pre>` element inside that displays the result of calling `JSON.stringify` on the `result` property of the `nodeValueQuery` object. The `<pre>` element is styled with a `maxWidth` of `200` and an `overflow` of `'auto'`.\n\nThe `PanelSpec` object is defined as an object with three properties: `id`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` property is set to the string `'unknown'`, the `Component` property is set to the `PanelNumber` component, and the `inputType` property is set to the `inputType` constant defined earlier. This `PanelSpec` object is exported from the module and can be used by other modules in the larger project to create instances of the `PanelNumber` component with the specified `id` and `inputType`.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Spec as PanelNumberSpec } from 'weave/panel-number';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <PanelNumberSpec.Component input={{ value: 42 }}>\n      {/* children */}\n    </PanelNumberSpec.Component>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelNumber` component?\n- The `PanelNumber` component is used to display the value of a node in a JSON format.\n\n2. What is the `useNodeValue` hook from `CGReact` library used for?\n- The `useNodeValue` hook is used to query the value of a node.\n\n3. What is the `PanelSpec` object used for?\n- The `PanelSpec` object is used to define the specifications of a panel, including its ID, component, and input type."
