  "summary": "This code defines several styled components and a theme object for the Weave project. The `StrippedContentEditable` component is imported from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/StrippedContentEditable` module, which is likely a custom component for handling contenteditable elements. The `globals` module is also imported, which likely contains global CSS styles for the project.\n\nThe `themes` object defines a `light` theme with various color values for different UI elements such as popups, backgrounds, text, and function names. These colors are likely used throughout the project to maintain a consistent visual style.\n\nThe `PanelNameSpan` component is a styled `span` element that capitalizes its text and aligns it with other elements. This component is likely used to display the names of different panels in the UI.\n\nThe `InlineContentEditable` component is a styled version of the `StrippedContentEditable` component that adds additional styles such as margin, padding, and border radius. It also changes the background color on hover and focus, depending on whether the component is disabled or not. This component is likely used for inline editing of text or other content in the UI.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components and a theme object that can be used throughout the Weave project to maintain a consistent visual style and provide consistent functionality for UI elements such as editable text.",
