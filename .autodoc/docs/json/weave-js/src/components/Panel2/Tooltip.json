  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for creating a tooltip component that can be used in the larger project. The tooltip component is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing it to be used in various contexts throughout the application.\n\nThe main component exported from this file is `TooltipTrigger`, which is a React functional component that takes several props to customize its behavior. These props include `content`, `copyableContent`, `extraButton`, `triggerContentHeight`, `showWithoutOverflow`, `showInFullscreen`, `noHeader`, `padding`, `positionNearMouse`, `TriggerWrapperComp`, `FrameComp`, and `BodyComp`. These props allow the user to customize the appearance and behavior of the tooltip.\n\nThe `TooltipTrigger` component uses several hooks and helper functions to manage its state and behavior. The `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks are used to calculate the position of the tooltip based on the anchor element and the tooltip's dimensions. The `useCallback` hook is used to define event handlers for mouse events, such as entering, leaving, and moving within the tooltip area.\n\nThe `TooltipContent` component is responsible for rendering the actual tooltip content, including the header, body, and optional extra button. It uses the `FrameComp` and `BodyComp` props to allow for customization of the tooltip's appearance.\n\nThe `TooltipPosition` type and related functions are used to calculate the optimal position for the tooltip based on the anchor element and the tooltip's dimensions. The `POSITION_STRATEGIES` array defines several strategies for positioning the tooltip, and the `getTooltipPosition` function selects the best strategy based on the available space in the viewport.\n\nIn summary, this code provides a flexible and customizable tooltip component that can be used throughout the larger project. The tooltip can be configured to display different content, respond to various mouse events, and position itself optimally based on the available space in the viewport.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `TooltipTrigger` component and how is it used?**\n\n   The `TooltipTrigger` component is a wrapper around a trigger element that displays a tooltip with the specified content when the trigger element is hovered over. It can be used by wrapping any element with the `TooltipTrigger` component and passing the required props such as `content`, `copyableContent`, and other optional props for customization.\n\n2. **How does the `positionNearMouse` prop affect the tooltip positioning?**\n\n   The `positionNearMouse` prop, when set to `true`, positions the tooltip near the mouse cursor instead of the default positioning strategy. It listens to the `mousemove` event and updates the tooltip's position accordingly.\n\n3. **How does the `extraButton` prop work in the `TooltipTrigger` component?**\n\n   The `extraButton` prop is an optional prop that can be passed to the `TooltipTrigger` component to add an extra button in the tooltip header. It should be an object with a `label` (the button text) and a `callback` (the function to be called when the button is clicked)."
