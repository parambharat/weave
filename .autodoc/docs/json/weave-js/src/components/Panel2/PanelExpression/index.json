  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a React component called `Spec`. This component is used to render an expression panel in the larger project called `weave`. \n\nThe `Spec` component is defined as an object with several properties. The `id` property is a string that identifies the panel as an expression panel. The `Component` property is a React component that is lazily loaded from a separate file called `Component.js`. The `inputType` property is an object that defines the type of input that the expression panel accepts. The `canFullscreen` property is a boolean that determines whether the panel can be displayed in full screen mode. Finally, the `defaultFixedSize` property is an object that defines the default size of the panel.\n\nThis module also exports two other items from a separate file called `common.js`. The first is a type called `PanelExpressionConfig`, which is used to define the configuration of the expression panel. The second is a constant called `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL`, which is an empty expression panel that can be used as a default value.\n\nThis module can be used in the larger `weave` project to render an expression panel. The `Spec` component can be imported and used in other components to display the expression panel. The `PanelExpressionConfig` type and `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL` constant can be used to define and initialize the expression panel. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Spec, PanelExpressionConfig, EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL } from 'weave';\n\nconst config: PanelExpressionConfig = {\n  // define configuration properties\n};\n\nconst expressionPanel = EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL;\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Spec config={config} panel={expressionPanel} />\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- The `weave` project is not described in the given code, so a smart developer might want to know what the overall goal of the project is and how this code contributes to it.\n\n2. What is the `Panel2` module that is being imported and used in this code?\n- A smart developer might want to know more about the `Panel2` module, such as what it contains and how it is used in the `weave` project.\n\n3. What is the `React.lazy` function and how is it being used in this code?\n- A smart developer might want to know more about the `React.lazy` function and how it is being used to import the `Component` module in this code."
