  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a constant and a panel specification object. The module imports React, a Panel2 module, and two constants from a common module. The exported constant is the defaultFacet constant from the common module. The exported panel specification object is an object that defines the properties of a panel in the larger project.\n\nThe panel specification object has an id property that identifies the panel as \"Facet\". The initialize property is a function that takes two arguments, weave and inputNode, and returns the defaultFacet constant from the common module. The ConfigComponent property is a React component that is lazily loaded from a Component module. The Component property is also a lazily loaded React component from the Component module. The inputType property is a constant from the common module. The hidden property is set to true, which means that the panel is not visible by default.\n\nThis module is likely used in the larger project to define a panel that allows users to filter data based on a specific facet. The panel specification object defines the properties of the panel, including its ID, initialization function, and React components. The defaultFacet constant is likely used to set the default values for the facet filter. The inputType constant is likely used to define the type of input that the panel accepts.\n\nExample usage of this module in the larger project might look like this:\n\n```\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/facet';\n\n// Add the facet panel to the project\nweave.addPanel(Spec);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import?\n   - A smart developer might wonder why `Panel2` is imported and not used in the code. It could be that it is used in another file or was previously used and not removed.\n\n2. What is the `initialize` function doing?\n   - A smart developer might want to know what the `initialize` function is doing and what parameters it takes. It appears to be returning the result of the `defaultFacet` function.\n\n3. Why is the `hidden` property set to `true`?\n   - A smart developer might question why the `hidden` property is set to `true` and what effect it has on the component. It could be that the component is not meant to be visible to the user or is hidden by default."
