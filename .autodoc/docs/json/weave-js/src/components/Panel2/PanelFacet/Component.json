  "summary": "The `PanelFacet` component in this code file is a part of a larger project that deals with rendering data in a flexible and customizable grid or flex layout. It takes an input node and configuration properties to determine how the data should be displayed and interacted with.\n\nThe component has two main modes: `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode`. The `PanelFacetFlexMode` is used when only the x-axis is enabled, and it displays the data in a flex layout. The `PanelFacetGridMode` is used when both x and y axes are enabled, and it displays the data in a grid layout.\n\nBoth modes make use of the `SelectPanel` component, which is responsible for rendering the appropriate panel based on the input node, select function, and other configuration properties. The `SelectPanel` component uses the `usePanelStacksForType` hook to determine the correct panel to render based on the select function's type.\n\nIn `PanelFacetFlexMode`, the data is displayed in a flex layout with each cell wrapped in a `div` element. If the `config.manualSize` property is set, the cells are resizable using the `Resizable` component from the `react-resizable` library.\n\nIn `PanelFacetGridMode`, the data is displayed in a grid layout using CSS Grid. The grid's columns and rows are determined by the unique x and y keys from the input data. Each cell in the grid is also resizable using the `Resizable` component.\n\nThe `PanelFacet` component itself determines which mode to use based on the configuration properties passed to it. If the y-axis is not enabled, it uses the `PanelFacetFlexMode`. Otherwise, it uses the `PanelFacetGridMode`.\n\nExample usage of the `PanelFacet` component:\n\n```jsx\n<PanelFacet\n  input={inputNode}\n  config={config}\n  context={panelContext}\n  updateConfig={updateConfig}\n  updateContext={updatePanelContext}\n/>\n```\n\nOverall, this code file provides a flexible and customizable way to display data in a grid or flex layout, with support for resizable cells and various panel types based on the input data and configuration properties.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PanelFacet` component and how does it decide between using `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode`?\n\n   **Answer**: The `PanelFacet` component is used to display a grid or flex layout of panels based on the provided configuration. It decides between using `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode` based on whether the `y` dimension is enabled or not. If `y` is not enabled, it uses the flex mode, otherwise, it uses the grid mode.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `SelectPanel` component handle the case when there is no panel for the given type?\n\n   **Answer**: The `SelectPanel` component checks if the `curPanelId` or `handler` is null. If either of them is null, it renders a `div` with a message stating that there is no panel for the given type.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the resizing of cells work in the `PanelFacetGridMode` component?\n\n   **Answer**: The `PanelFacetGridMode` component uses the `Resizable` component from the `react-resizable` library to handle cell resizing. It maintains a state called `resizingSize` to store the current resizing dimensions and updates the state during the resizing process. Once the resizing is stopped, it updates the cell size in the configuration using the `updateConfig` prop."
