  "summary": "The `PanelFileText` component is a React functional component that renders a file's contents as text. It is part of the larger `weave` project and imports several dependencies such as `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, and `semantic-ui-react`. \n\nThe component takes in a `PanelProps` object as its props, which is defined in the `Panel` module. The `PanelProps` object has a type of `inputType`, which is also defined in the `Panel` module. The `PanelFileText` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to retrieve the contents of the file and then processes the text for display using the `processTextForDisplay` function. The processed text is then highlighted using the `Prism` library and displayed in a `pre` tag.\n\nThe `PanelFileText` component has a file size limit of 25 MB, a line length limit of 1000 characters, and a total lines limit of 10000. If the file size exceeds the limit, a message is displayed indicating that the text view is limited to files less than the specified size. If any lines are truncated, a warning message is displayed indicating the number of lines truncated and the maximum line length.\n\nThe `PanelFileText` component exports the `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component, which is the actual component that renders the file's contents as text. The `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the processed results and the `useEffect` hook to highlight the text using `Prism`. The `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component also renders warning messages if any lines are truncated.\n\nThe `languageFromFileName` function is a helper function that takes in a file extension and returns the corresponding language for syntax highlighting. It uses the `EXTENSION_INFO` object, which is defined in the `common` module, to map file extensions to languages.\n\nOverall, the `PanelFileText` component is a useful component for displaying the contents of a file as text. It has several limits to prevent the display of large files and provides warning messages if any lines are truncated. The component also uses the `Prism` library for syntax highlighting and the `CGReact` module for retrieving the contents of the file.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a React component called `PanelFileText` that renders the contents of a file with syntax highlighting and truncation limits for display.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code imports several external libraries including `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, and `semantic-ui-react`. It also imports several modules from within the `weave` project.\n\n3. What are the limitations of the `PanelFileText` component?\n   - The `PanelFileText` component has several limitations including a file size limit of 25 MB, a line length limit of 1000 characters, and a total lines limit of 10000. Files that exceed these limits will not be fully displayed."
