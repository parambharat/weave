  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a PanelSpec object and some other variables and functions. The purpose of this module is to provide a specification for a panel that displays text input. \n\nThe PanelSpec object contains three properties: id, Component, and inputType. The id property is a string that identifies the panel. The Component property is a React component that renders the panel. The inputType property is an object that specifies the type of input that the panel accepts. \n\nThe Component property is defined using React.lazy, which is a function that allows for lazy loading of components. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve performance. The Component itself is defined in a separate file that is imported using the dynamic import syntax. \n\nThe inputType variable is imported from another file called common. This file also exports two other variables: EXTENSION_INFO and processTextForDisplay. These variables and functions are also exported by this module, which means that they can be used by other parts of the project that import this module. \n\nOverall, this module provides a specification for a text input panel that can be used in the larger project. The PanelSpec object defines the properties of the panel, including its ID, the component that renders it, and the type of input it accepts. The other exported variables and functions provide additional functionality that can be used by other parts of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Spec, processTextForDisplay } from 'weave/text';\n\n// Use the Spec object to create a new panel\nconst myPanel = new Panel(Spec);\n\n// Use the processTextForDisplay function to format text for display\nconst formattedText = processTextForDisplay('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet');\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - A smart developer might ask what the `Panel2` module contains and how it is used in this code. It appears to be imported and used to define the `PanelSpec` object.\n2. What is the significance of the `lazy` function being used to import the `Component` module?\n   - A smart developer might ask why the `lazy` function is being used to import the `Component` module. This suggests that the `Component` module may be large or slow to load, and the `lazy` function allows it to be loaded asynchronously.\n3. What is the purpose of the `EXTENSION_INFO` and `processTextForDisplay` exports from the `common` module?\n   - A smart developer might ask what the `EXTENSION_INFO` and `processTextForDisplay` exports from the `common` module are used for and how they are related to the `Spec` object. These exports are being re-exported from this module, which suggests they may be used elsewhere in the project."
