      "summary": "The `PanelFileText` component is a React functional component that renders a file's contents as text. It is part of the larger `weave` project and imports several dependencies such as `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, and `semantic-ui-react`. \n\nThe component takes in a `PanelProps` object as its props, which is defined in the `Panel` module. The `PanelProps` object has a type of `inputType`, which is also defined in the `Panel` module. The `PanelFileText` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to retrieve the contents of the file and then processes the text for display using the `processTextForDisplay` function. The processed text is then highlighted using the `Prism` library and displayed in a `pre` tag.\n\nThe `PanelFileText` component has a file size limit of 25 MB, a line length limit of 1000 characters, and a total lines limit of 10000. If the file size exceeds the limit, a message is displayed indicating that the text view is limited to files less than the specified size. If any lines are truncated, a warning message is displayed indicating the number of lines truncated and the maximum line length.\n\nThe `PanelFileText` component exports the `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component, which is the actual component that renders the file's contents as text. The `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the processed results and the `useEffect` hook to highlight the text using `Prism`. The `PanelFileTextRenderInner` component also renders warning messages if any lines are truncated.\n\nThe `languageFromFileName` function is a helper function that takes in a file extension and returns the corresponding language for syntax highlighting. It uses the `EXTENSION_INFO` object, which is defined in the `common` module, to map file extensions to languages.\n\nOverall, the `PanelFileText` component is a useful component for displaying the contents of a file as text. It has several limits to prevent the display of large files and provides warning messages if any lines are truncated. The component also uses the `Prism` library for syntax highlighting and the `CGReact` module for retrieving the contents of the file.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a React component called `PanelFileText` that renders the contents of a file with syntax highlighting and truncation limits for display.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code imports several external libraries including `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, and `semantic-ui-react`. It also imports several modules from within the `weave` project.\n\n3. What are the limitations of the `PanelFileText` component?\n   - The `PanelFileText` component has several limitations including a file size limit of 25 MB, a line length limit of 1000 characters, and a total lines limit of 10000. Files that exceed these limits will not be fully displayed."

      "summary": "This file contains several constants and a function that are used in the larger weave project. The `EXTENSION_INFO` constant is an object that maps file extensions to their corresponding types. For example, the extension `.md` is mapped to the type `markdown`. This constant is used throughout the project to determine the type of a file based on its extension.\n\nThe `inputType` constant is an object that describes the expected input for a function in the project. It is a union type that includes all of the file extensions in `EXTENSION_INFO`. This constant is used to validate input to the function and ensure that it is a valid file type.\n\nThe `processTextForDisplay` function takes in a file extension, some text, and two limits (one for line length and one for total lines) and processes the text for display. It first splits the text into an array of lines and then performs some additional processing based on the file extension. For example, if the file extension is `.json` and the text is a single line, it attempts to parse the JSON and pretty-print it. If the file extension is `.ipynb`, it attempts to parse the text as JSON and extract the source code from the notebook cells.\n\nAfter any additional processing, the function truncates lines that are too long and limits the total number of lines based on the provided limits. It then returns an object that includes the processed text, as well as flags indicating whether any lines or the total number of lines were truncated.\n\nOverall, this file provides some useful constants and a function that are used throughout the larger weave project to handle file types and process text for display. Here is an example of how the `EXTENSION_INFO` constant might be used in another file:\n\n```\nimport { EXTENSION_INFO } from 'weave';\n\nconst fileType = EXTENSION_INFO['.md']; // 'markdown'\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EXTENSION_INFO` object?\n   - The `EXTENSION_INFO` object maps file extensions to their corresponding types (e.g. 'json' maps to 'json'). \n\n2. What is the `inputType` object used for?\n   - The `inputType` object is used to define a union type for file inputs, where each member is a file with a specific extension defined in `EXTENSION_INFO`.\n\n3. What does the `processTextForDisplay` function do?\n   - The `processTextForDisplay` function takes in a file extension, text content, and limits for line length and total lines, and returns an object with the processed text, as well as flags indicating whether any lines or the total number of lines were truncated. It also includes special handling for JSON and IPython Notebook files."

      "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a PanelSpec object and some other variables and functions. The purpose of this module is to provide a specification for a panel that displays text input. \n\nThe PanelSpec object contains three properties: id, Component, and inputType. The id property is a string that identifies the panel. The Component property is a React component that renders the panel. The inputType property is an object that specifies the type of input that the panel accepts. \n\nThe Component property is defined using React.lazy, which is a function that allows for lazy loading of components. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve performance. The Component itself is defined in a separate file that is imported using the dynamic import syntax. \n\nThe inputType variable is imported from another file called common. This file also exports two other variables: EXTENSION_INFO and processTextForDisplay. These variables and functions are also exported by this module, which means that they can be used by other parts of the project that import this module. \n\nOverall, this module provides a specification for a text input panel that can be used in the larger project. The PanelSpec object defines the properties of the panel, including its ID, the component that renders it, and the type of input it accepts. The other exported variables and functions provide additional functionality that can be used by other parts of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Spec, processTextForDisplay } from 'weave/text';\n\n// Use the Spec object to create a new panel\nconst myPanel = new Panel(Spec);\n\n// Use the processTextForDisplay function to format text for display\nconst formattedText = processTextForDisplay('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet');\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - A smart developer might ask what the `Panel2` module contains and how it is used in this code. It appears to be imported and used to define the `PanelSpec` object.\n2. What is the significance of the `lazy` function being used to import the `Component` module?\n   - A smart developer might ask why the `lazy` function is being used to import the `Component` module. This suggests that the `Component` module may be large or slow to load, and the `lazy` function allows it to be loaded asynchronously.\n3. What is the purpose of the `EXTENSION_INFO` and `processTextForDisplay` exports from the `common` module?\n   - A smart developer might ask what the `EXTENSION_INFO` and `processTextForDisplay` exports from the `common` module are used for and how they are related to the `Spec` object. These exports are being re-exported from this module, which suggests they may be used elsewhere in the project."
