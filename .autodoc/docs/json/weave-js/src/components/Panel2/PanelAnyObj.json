  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports two components: `PanelAnyObj` and `Spec`. The `PanelAnyObj` component is a React functional component that takes in a prop of type `PanelAnyObjProps`. The `PanelAnyObjProps` type is defined as a type alias for `PanelProps` from the `./panel` module, with the generic type argument set to `typeof inputType`. `inputType` is defined as a string literal type with the value `'any'`.\n\nThe `PanelAnyObj` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `../../react` module to retrieve the value of the `input` prop passed to it. It then uses the `useGatedValue` hook from the `../../hookUtils` module to ensure that the component only renders once the `nodeValueQuery` object has finished loading. If `nodeValueQuery.loading` is true, the component returns a `Panel2Loader` component. Otherwise, it returns a `pre` element that displays the result of `JSON.stringify(nodeValueQuery.result, undefined, 2)`.\n\nThe `Spec` object is an object that defines the specifications for the `PanelAnyObj` component. It has three properties: `hidden`, `id`, and `Component`. `hidden` is a boolean that is set to `true`, indicating that the component should be hidden. `id` is a string that is set to `'any-obj'`, which is used to identify the component. `Component` is a reference to the `PanelAnyObj` component.\n\nThis module is likely used in a larger project to define a panel that displays the value of an input object of type `any`. The `PanelAnyObj` component retrieves the value of the input object and displays it as a JSON string. The `Spec` object is used to define the specifications for the panel, including its visibility and identification. Other modules in the project may use this module to create and display panels for other types of input objects. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Spec, PanelAnyObj } from 'weave';\n\nconst myInput = { foo: 'bar', baz: 123 };\n\nconst myPanel = {\n  ...Spec,\n  Component: PanelAnyObj,\n  input: myInput,\n};\n\n// Render myPanel in the UI\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useGatedValue` hook being imported from `hookUtils`?\n- The smart developer might wonder why `useGatedValue` is being used in this code. `useGatedValue` is used to delay the rendering of the component until the data is ready, and it is imported from `hookUtils`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `PanelAnyObjProps` type?\n- The smart developer might wonder what the `PanelAnyObjProps` type is used for. It is used to define the props that are passed to the `PanelAnyObj` component, and it is based on the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel2` module.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Spec` object?\n- The smart developer might wonder what the `Spec` object is used for. It is used to define the specifications for the `PanelAnyObj` component, including its ID, whether it is hidden, and its input type."
