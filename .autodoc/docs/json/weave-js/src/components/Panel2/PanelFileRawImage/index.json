  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a constant called `Spec`. This constant is an object that defines the specifications for a panel in the larger project. The panel is specifically for displaying raw images and is identified by the `id` property with a value of `'rawimage'`. The `displayName` property is used to give the panel a user-friendly name of `'Image'`.\n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that is lazily loaded using the `React.lazy()` function. This means that the component is only loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve the performance of the application. The component is imported from a file located in the same directory as this module.\n\nThe `inputType` property is imported from another file called `common`. This property is used to specify the type of input that the panel expects. It is likely that this input type is related to the raw image data that the panel is designed to display.\n\nOverall, this module is responsible for defining the specifications for a panel that displays raw images in the larger project. The `Spec` constant is likely used by other parts of the project to create and render the panel. Here is an example of how this module might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/panels/rawimage';\n\n// create a new panel using the specifications defined in Spec\nconst panel = new Panel(Spec);\n\n// render the panel\npanel.render();\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The smart developer might wonder about the contents of the `../panel` file and how it relates to this code. The `Panel2` import is likely used to access components or functions defined in that file.\n2. What is the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The developer might be curious about the `inputType` variable used in the `Spec` object. It is likely defined in the `./common` file and exported for use in this code.\n3. What is the significance of the `React.lazy` function used in the `Component` property of the `Spec` object?\n   - The developer might want to know more about the `React.lazy` function and how it is used in this code. It is likely used to lazily load the `Component` module, improving performance by only loading it when needed."
