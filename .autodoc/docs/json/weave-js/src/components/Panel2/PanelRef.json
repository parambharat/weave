  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports two objects: `PanelRef` and `Spec`. The `PanelRef` object is a React functional component that renders a panel displaying the name of a reference. The `Spec` object is a panel specification that defines the `PanelRef` component as the component to be used for a panel with an ID of \"Ref\".\n\nThe `PanelRef` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object that contains an input property. The input property is expected to be a reference to a resource, represented as a URL string. The component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to fetch the value of the input reference. If the value is still loading, the component returns a `Panel2Loader` component, which is presumably a loading spinner or placeholder. If the value is null or undefined, the component returns a simple div element with a hyphen (\"-\") as its content. Otherwise, the component extracts the name of the reference from the URL and renders it in a div element.\n\nThe `Spec` object is a panel specification that defines the `PanelRef` component as the component to be used for a panel with an ID of \"Ref\". The `inputType` constant is an object that specifies the expected type of the input property of the `PanelRef` component. It is used to define the type of the `PanelRefProps` type, which is then used as the type of the `props` parameter of the `PanelRef` component.\n\nThis module is likely part of a larger project that involves rendering various types of panels based on different types of input data. The `PanelRef` component is specifically designed to render a panel that displays the name of a reference, and the `Spec` object is used to register this component as the component to be used for a panel with an ID of \"Ref\". Other modules in the project may define other types of panels and register them using similar panel specifications.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelRef` component?\n- The `PanelRef` component is used to display the name of a referenced panel.\n\n2. What is the `inputType` variable used for?\n- The `inputType` variable is used to define the type of the `input` prop passed to the `PanelRef` component.\n\n3. What is the `Spec` object used for?\n- The `Spec` object is used to define the specifications for the `PanelRef` component, including its ID, component, and input type."
