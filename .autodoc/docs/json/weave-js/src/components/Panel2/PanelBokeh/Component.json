  "summary": "The `PanelBokeh` module is a React functional component that renders a Bokeh plot using the `BokehViewer` component. The component takes in a single prop, `input`, which is of type `inputType` defined in the `common` module. \n\nThe `useAssetContentFromArtifact` hook is used to retrieve the contents of the `inputNode` artifact. If the contents are still loading, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, the contents are parsed as JSON and passed as a prop to the `BokehViewer` component.\n\nThis module is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying various types of data visualizations. The `PanelBokeh` component specifically handles Bokeh plots, which are interactive visualizations created using the Bokeh library. By using this component, developers can easily render Bokeh plots by passing in the appropriate `input` prop. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport PanelBokeh from './PanelBokeh';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const input = {\n    artifactId: 'my-bokeh-plot',\n    version: '1.0.0'\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Bokeh Plot</h1>\n      <PanelBokeh input={input} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PanelBokeh` component is used to render a Bokeh plot with the artifact ID `my-bokeh-plot` and version `1.0.0`. The resulting plot is displayed within a larger component with a heading of \"My Bokeh Plot\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BokehViewer` component being imported?\n- The `BokehViewer` component is being imported from a file located at `../BokehViewer` and is likely used to display Bokeh visualizations.\n\n2. What is the `useAssetContentFromArtifact` function and where is it defined?\n- The `useAssetContentFromArtifact` function is being imported from a file located at `../useAssetFromArtifact` and is likely used to retrieve asset content from an artifact.\n\n3. What is the `PanelProps` type and where is it defined?\n- The `PanelProps` type is being used as a generic type for the `PanelBokeh` component and is likely defined in the `../panel` file."
