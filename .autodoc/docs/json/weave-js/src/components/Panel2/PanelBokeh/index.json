  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a constant object called `Spec`. This object is of type `Panel2.PanelSpec` and contains four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that identifies the panel. In this case, it is set to `'bokeh-file'`. The `displayName` property is also a string that represents the name of the panel as it will be displayed to the user. In this case, it is set to `'Bokeh'`.\n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that will be rendered when the panel is displayed. It is created using the `React.lazy()` function, which allows for lazy loading of the component. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve performance. The component is imported from the `./Component` module.\n\nThe `inputType` property is an object that defines the input types that the panel accepts. It is imported from the `./common` module.\n\nThis module is likely part of a larger project that involves creating panels for a web application. The `Spec` object is likely used by a panel manager or router to dynamically render the appropriate panel based on user input or other factors. \n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/bokeh';\n\n// Render the Bokeh panel\nfunction renderBokehPanel() {\n  const { Component } = Spec;\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{Spec.displayName}</h1>\n      <Component />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `Spec` object is imported from the `weave/bokeh` module. The `Component` property is then used to render the panel. The `displayName` property is also used to display the name of the panel to the user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The smart developer might wonder about the contents of the `../panel` file and how it relates to this code. The `Panel2` import is likely used to access components or functions defined in that file.\n2. What is the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The developer might be curious about the `inputType` variable used in the `Spec` object. It is likely defined in the `./common` file and exported for use in this code.\n3. What is the `React.lazy` function and how does it work?\n   - The developer might not be familiar with the `React.lazy` function used to import the `Component` module. They may want to know more about how it works and what benefits it provides for code splitting and performance optimization."
