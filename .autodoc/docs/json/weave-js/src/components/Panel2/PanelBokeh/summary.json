      "summary": "The `PanelBokeh` module is a React functional component that renders a Bokeh plot using the `BokehViewer` component. The component takes in a single prop, `input`, which is of type `inputType` defined in the `common` module. \n\nThe `useAssetContentFromArtifact` hook is used to retrieve the contents of the `inputNode` artifact. If the contents are still loading, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, the contents are parsed as JSON and passed as a prop to the `BokehViewer` component.\n\nThis module is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying various types of data visualizations. The `PanelBokeh` component specifically handles Bokeh plots, which are interactive visualizations created using the Bokeh library. By using this component, developers can easily render Bokeh plots by passing in the appropriate `input` prop. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport PanelBokeh from './PanelBokeh';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const input = {\n    artifactId: 'my-bokeh-plot',\n    version: '1.0.0'\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Bokeh Plot</h1>\n      <PanelBokeh input={input} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PanelBokeh` component is used to render a Bokeh plot with the artifact ID `my-bokeh-plot` and version `1.0.0`. The resulting plot is displayed within a larger component with a heading of \"My Bokeh Plot\".",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `BokehViewer` component being imported?\n- The `BokehViewer` component is being imported from a file located at `../BokehViewer` and is likely used to display Bokeh visualizations.\n\n2.

      "summary": "The code snippet above defines a constant variable called `inputType` that is exported for use in other parts of the `weave` project. The `inputType` object has a single property called `type` which is set to the string value `'bokeh-file'`. The `as const` syntax is used to ensure that the `type` property is a literal type and not a string type.\n\nThis code is likely used to define the type of input that the `weave` project can accept. Specifically, it appears that the project can accept input in the form of a Bokeh file. Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations, so it is possible that the `weave` project is designed to work with Bokeh visualizations in some way.\n\nThis code can be used in other parts of the `weave` project to ensure that the input being provided is of the correct type. For example, if there is a function that accepts input from the user, it could check that the input is of type `'bokeh-file'` before proceeding with any further processing. Here is an example of how this code could be used:\n\n```\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction processInput(input: any) {\n  if (input.type === inputType.type) {\n    // input is a valid Bokeh file, proceed with processing\n  } else {\n    // input is not a valid Bokeh file, handle error\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code serves as a way to define and enforce the expected input type for the `weave` project. By using a constant variable, the input type can be easily referenced and reused throughout the project.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `inputType` constant?\n   \n   Answer: The `inputType` constant is used to define the type of input as a `bokeh-file`.\n\n2. Why is the `as const` keyword used in the `inputType` constant?\n\n   Answer: The `as const` keyword is used to ensure that the `type` property of the `inputType` object is a literal type and cannot be changed.\n\n3. Where is the `inputType` constant being used in the `weave` project?\n\n   Answer: Without further context, it is unclear where the `inputType` constant is being used in the `weave` project."

      "summary": "The code above is a module that exports a constant object called `Spec`. This object is of type `Panel2.PanelSpec` and contains four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that identifies the panel. In this case, it is set to `'bokeh-file'`. The `displayName` property is also a string that represents the name of the panel as it will be displayed to the user. In this case, it is set to `'Bokeh'`.\n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that will be rendered when the panel is displayed. It is created using the `React.lazy()` function, which allows for lazy loading of the component. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve performance. The component is imported from the `./Component` module.\n\nThe `inputType` property is an object that defines the input types that the panel accepts. It is imported from the `./common` module.\n\nThis module is likely part of a larger project that involves creating panels for a web application. The `Spec` object is likely used by a panel manager or router to dynamically render the appropriate panel based on user input or other factors. \n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/bokeh';\n\n// Render the Bokeh panel\nfunction renderBokehPanel() {\n  const { Component } = Spec;\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{Spec.displayName}</h1>\n      <Component />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `Spec` object is imported from the `weave/bokeh` module.

      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The smart developer might wonder about the contents of the `../panel` file and how it relates to this code. The `Panel2` import is likely used to access components or functions defined in that file.\n2. What is the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The developer might be curious about the `inputType` variable used in the `Spec` object. It is likely defined in the `./common` file and exported for use in this code.\n3. What is the `React.lazy` function and how does it work?\n   - The developer might not be familiar with the `React.lazy` function used to import the `Component` module.

  "summary": "The `PanelBokeh` folder contains code for a React component that renders a Bokeh plot within a larger project, likely involving various data visualizations. The folder consists of three files: `Component.tsx`, `common.ts`, and `index.ts`.\n\n`Component.tsx` defines a React functional component called `PanelBokeh` that takes a single prop, `input`, of type `inputType` defined in `common.ts`. The component uses the `useAssetContentFromArtifact` hook to retrieve the contents of the `inputNode` artifact. If the contents are still loading, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, the contents are parsed as JSON and passed as a prop to the `BokehViewer` component. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport PanelBokeh from './PanelBokeh';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const input = {\n    artifactId: 'my-bokeh-plot',\n    version: '1.0.0'\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Bokeh Plot</h1>\n      <PanelBokeh input={input} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n`common.ts` exports a constant variable called `inputType` with a single property `type` set to `'bokeh-file'`. This code is used to define the type of input that the project can accept, specifically Bokeh files. It can be used in other parts of the project to ensure that the input being provided is of the correct type. Example usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction processInput(input: any) {\n  if (input.type === inputType.type) {\n    // input is a valid Bokeh file, proceed with processing\n  } else {\n    // input is not a valid Bokeh file, handle error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`index.ts` exports a constant object called `Spec` of type `Panel2.PanelSpec` with four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` and `displayName` properties are strings identifying and naming the panel, respectively. The `Component` property is a React component created using `React.lazy()`, allowing for lazy loading. The `inputType` property is imported from `./common`. The `Spec` object is likely used by a panel manager or router to dynamically render the appropriate panel based on user input or other factors.

The code enforces the expected input type and allows for dynamic rendering of the panel based on user input or other factors.",
