  "summary": "This code defines a set of React components that render SVG icons. The icons are imported from various SVG files located in the `assets` directory. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all SVG icons used in the larger project, making it easier to manage and update them. \n\nEach SVG icon component takes in SVGProps as a prop, which is a type defined in the `react` library. The `updateIconProps` function is used to set default values for the `width` and `height` props, and then spread the rest of the props onto the returned object. This ensures that all SVG icons have consistent sizing and can be easily customized with additional props.\n\nThe SVG icon components are then exported for use in other parts of the project. For example, the `IconWeaveLogo` component can be used to render the Weave logo, while the `IconDelete` component can be used to render a delete icon. \n\nIn addition to the SVG icon components, there are also a few components that wrap the imported SVG components and apply a consistent style to them. These include `AgentSVG`, `ToolSVG`, `ChainSVG`, `LLMSVG`, `PromptSVG`, `DownSVG`, and `NextSVG`. These components are likely used in specific parts of the project where the icons need to be styled in a certain way.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to manage and use SVG icons in a React project. By centralizing the icons in one file, it makes it easier to maintain and update them, and ensures that they are used consistently throughout the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `updateIconProps` function?\n   - The `updateIconProps` function is used to set default width and height values for SVG icons and to spread any additional props passed to the component.\n\n2. Why are there so many import statements for SVG icons?\n   - The import statements are used to import SVG icons as React components from various files located in the `assets` directory.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `style` object and how is it used?\n   - The `style` object is used to set CSS styles for SVG icons that are displayed inline. It is used in several components to set the `style` prop of the SVG element."
