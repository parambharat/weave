  "summary": "The `weave` project contains a file that exports a React component called `PanelCard` and a configuration editor component called `PanelCardConfigEditor`. These components are used to create a card with tabs that can display different content. \n\nThe `PanelCard` component takes in a `PanelCardProps` object, which is defined as a type alias for `Panel2.PanelProps<typeof inputType, PanelCardConfig>`. `Panel2` is another module in the `weave` project that exports a `PanelProps` interface. `inputType` is a constant string value that is used as a type parameter for `PanelProps`. `PanelCardConfig` is an interface that defines the shape of the configuration object that is passed to the `PanelCard` component. \n\nThe `PanelCard` component renders a `Card` styled component that contains a `CardHeader`, `CardTabs`, and `CardContent`. The `CardHeader` contains a `CardTitle` and `CardSubtitle`, and the `CardTabs` contains a list of `CardTab` components that are generated from the `content` property of the configuration object. The `CardContent` contains a `ChildPanel` component that renders the content of the currently selected tab. \n\nThe `PanelCardConfigEditor` component is used to edit the configuration object that is passed to the `PanelCard` component. It renders a `ConfigPanel.ConfigOption` component that contains a `ConfigPanel.ExpressionConfigField` component. The `ExpressionConfigField` component takes in an `expr` property that is the current value of the `title` property of the configuration object. When the user updates the value of the `ExpressionConfigField`, the `setExpression` function is called with the new value, and the `updateConfig` function is called with a new configuration object that has the updated `title` property. \n\nOverall, the `PanelCard` and `PanelCardConfigEditor` components are used to create a reusable card with tabs that can display different content. The `PanelCard` component takes in a configuration object that defines the title, subtitle, and content of the card, and the `PanelCardConfigEditor` component is used to edit the configuration object.",

What is the purpose of the `PanelCardConfigEditor` component and how is it used?\n- The `PanelCardConfigEditor` component is used to edit the configuration of a `PanelCard` component, specifically the `title` property.
