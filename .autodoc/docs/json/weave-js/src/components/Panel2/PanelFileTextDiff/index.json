  "summary": "The code above is defining a `Spec` object that is used to specify the properties of a panel in the `weave` project. The `Spec` object has four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the panel. In this case, the `id` is set to `'textdiff'`. \n\nThe `displayName` property is a string that is used to display the name of the panel in the user interface. In this case, the `displayName` is set to `'File Diff'`. \n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that is used to render the panel. In this case, the `Component` is set to a lazy-loaded component that is imported from the `./Component` file. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can help improve performance. \n\nThe `inputType` property is an object that specifies the type of input that the panel expects. The `inputType` object is imported from the `./common` file. \n\nOverall, this code is used to define a panel in the `weave` project that displays a file diff. The `Spec` object specifies the properties of the panel, including its unique identifier, display name, and the React component used to render it. The `inputType` property specifies the type of input that the panel expects. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger `weave` project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/panel/textdiff';\n\nconst myPanel = {\n  ...Spec,\n  displayName: 'My File Diff Panel',\n  inputType: {\n    type: 'file',\n    multiple: true,\n  },\n};\n\n// Use myPanel in the project\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Spec` object is imported from the `textdiff` file in the `weave/panel` directory. The `myPanel` object is created by spreading the `Spec` object and overriding the `displayName` and `inputType` properties. This allows the panel to be customized for a specific use case. Finally, the `myPanel` object can be used in the project to display a file diff panel with the desired properties.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `Panel2` import is likely a module or component from another file in the `weave` project. It is used to define the `PanelSpec` object in this file.\n2. What is the significance of the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The `inputType` variable is likely a constant or function defined in another file in the `weave` project. It is used as a property in the `Spec` object.\n3. What is the purpose of the `React.lazy` function and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `React.lazy` function is used to lazily load the `Component` module when it is needed, rather than loading it immediately. This can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application."
