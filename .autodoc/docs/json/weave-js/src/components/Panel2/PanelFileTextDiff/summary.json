      "summary": "The `PanelFileTextCompare` component is a React functional component that renders a file comparison view for text files. It is part of the larger `weave` project and imports several dependencies from external libraries such as `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, `react`, `react-diff-viewer`, and `semantic-ui-react`. \n\nThe component takes in a single prop, `inputType`, which is a type definition for the input data. The component then uses this input data to fetch the contents of the files to be compared and their sizes using the `opFileContents` and `opFileSize` functions respectively from the `@wandb/weave/core` library. \n\nThe `PanelFileTextCompare` component then renders a `PanelFileTextCompareSizeGuard` component that checks if the size of any of the files to be compared exceeds a certain limit (25MB) and displays a warning message if so. If the files are within the size limit, the `PanelFileTextCompare` component renders a `PanelFileTextCompareContents` component that processes the file contents for display and renders a `ReactDiffViewer` component that displays the differences between the two files. \n\nThe `PanelFileTextCompareViewer` component processes the file contents for display by splitting the files into lines and truncating lines that exceed a certain length (500 characters) or the total number of lines exceeds a certain limit (1000 lines). It then renders a `ReactDiffViewer` component that displays the differences between the two files using the `highlightSyntax` function to highlight the syntax of the files using the `prismjs` library. \n\nOverall, the `PanelFileTextCompare` component provides a simple and intuitive way to compare the contents of two text files and highlight their differences. It is a useful component for developers who need to compare the contents of two files and identify the differences between them. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport PanelFileTextCompare from 'weave/components/PanelFileTextCompare';\n\nconst input = {\n  file: [\n    {path: 'file1.txt', type: 'file'},\n    {path: 'file2.txt', type: 'file'},\n  ],\n};\n\n<PanelFileTextCompare input={input} />;\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `PanelFileTextCompare` that displays the difference between two text files in a side-by-side view with syntax highlighting.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code use?\n- This code imports several external libraries including `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `Prism`, `React`, `ReactDiffViewer`, and `semantic-ui-react`.\n\n3. What are the limitations of the text view?\n- The text view is limited to files less than 25 MB in size, and may truncate lines to 500 characters or limit the total number of lines to 1000 for display. If files are truncated, the diff display may not show all mismatches."

      "summary": "The code in this file defines an object called `inputType` which is used to specify the types of input that can be accepted by the `weave` project. The `inputType` object is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the project.\n\nThe `inputType` object is defined as a union type, which means that it can accept multiple types of input. The `members` property of the object is an array of objects, each of which specifies a different type of input that can be accepted. \n\nEach object in the `members` array specifies a `list` type, which means that it can accept a list of files. The `objectType` property of each object specifies that the input should be a file with a specific extension. The extension is determined by iterating over the `EXTENSION_INFO` object in the `PanelFileText` module and extracting the keys.\n\nOverall, this code is used to define the types of input that can be accepted by the `weave` project. It is likely that this object is used in other parts of the project to validate user input and ensure that the correct types of files are being used. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\n// Validate user input\nfunction validateInput(input) {\n  if (inputType.members.some(member => {\n    // Check if input matches any of the specified types\n    return member.type === 'list' && input.every(file => {\n      return file.type === 'file' && file.extension === member.objectType.extension;\n    });\n  })) {\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```",

      "summary": "The code above is defining a `Spec` object that is used to specify the properties of a panel in the `weave` project. The `Spec` object has four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the panel. In this case, the `id` is set to `'textdiff'`. \n\nThe `displayName` property is a string that is used to display the name of the panel in the user interface. In this case, the `displayName` is set to `'File Diff'`. \n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that is used to render the panel. In this case, the `Component` is set to a lazy-loaded component that is imported from the `./Component` file. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can help improve performance. \n\nThe `inputType` property is an object that specifies the type of input that the panel expects. The `inputType` object is imported from the `./common` file. \n\nOverall, this code is used to define a panel in the `weave` project that displays a file diff. The `Spec` object specifies the properties of the panel, including its unique identifier, display name, and the React component used to render it. The `inputType` property specifies the type of input that the panel expects. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger `weave` project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/panel/textdiff';\n\nconst myPanel = {\n  ...Spec,\n  displayName: 'My File Diff Panel',\n  inputType: {\n    type: 'file',\n    multiple: true,\n  },\n};\n\n// Use myPanel in the project\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Spec` object is imported from the `textdiff` file in the `weave/panel` directory. The `myPanel` object is created by spreading the `Spec` object and overriding the `displayName` and `inputType` properties. This allows the panel to be customized for a specific use case. Finally, the `myPanel` object can be used in the project to display a file diff panel with the desired properties.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `Panel2` import is likely a module or component from another file in the `weave` project. It is used to define the `PanelSpec` object in this file.\n2. What is the significance of the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The `inputType` variable is likely a constant or function defined in another file in the `weave` project. It is used as a property in the `Spec` object.\n3. What is the purpose of the `React.lazy` function and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `React.lazy` function is used to lazily load the `Component` module when it is needed, rather than loading it immediately. This can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application."

  "summary": "The `PanelFileTextDiff` folder contains code for a `weave` project component that allows users to compare the contents of two text files and highlight their differences. The folder consists of three files: `Component.tsx`, `common.ts`, and `index.ts`.\n\n`Component.tsx` defines the `PanelFileTextCompare` component, a React functional component that renders a file comparison view for text files.
