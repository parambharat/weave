  "summary": "This file contains TypeScript interfaces and functions related to defining and rendering panels in the Weave project. Panels are components that display data visualizations and other information to users. \n\nThe `PanelSpec` interface defines the properties of a panel, including its ID, display name, and the React component that renders the panel. The `initialize` property is a function that is called when the panel is first created, and it returns the initial configuration for the panel. The `inputType` property specifies the type of data that the panel expects as input, and the `outputType` property specifies the type of data that the panel produces as output. The `ConfigComponent` property is a React component that renders the configuration options for the panel. \n\nThe `PanelConvertSpec` interface is similar to `PanelSpec`, but it is used for panels that convert the input data to a different type. The `convert` property is a function that takes the input type and returns the output type. \n\nThe `PanelPropsInternal` interface defines the properties that are passed to a panel component. These include the input data, the context object, the configuration options, and functions for updating the context and configuration. \n\nThe `getDisplayName` function takes a `PanelSpecNode` object and returns the display name for the panel. If the `displayName` property is set, it is used as the display name. Otherwise, the ID of the panel is split into words and capitalized, and the words are joined together to form the display name. \n\nThe `getStackIdAndName` function takes a `PanelSpecNode` object and returns an object with the ID and display name of the panel. If the panel has a child panel, the child's ID and display name are appended to the parent's ID and display name, separated by a \"â–¸\" character. The function also includes some special cases for cosmetic purposes, such as hiding certain panels in the stack or combining the names of certain panels. \n\nOverall, this file provides the interfaces and functions necessary for defining and rendering panels in the Weave project. Developers can use these interfaces and functions to create custom panels that display data visualizations and other information to users.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelSpec` interface and its related types?\n- The `PanelSpec` interface and its related types define the structure and behavior of a panel in the `weave` project, including its input and output types, display name, and configuration options.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `updateInput` function in the `PanelPropsInternal` interface?\n- The `updateInput` function allows a child component to update the input data for its parent component, either by passing a Weave function or a Node with no variables that can be evaluated.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getStackIdAndName` function?\n- The `getStackIdAndName` function returns the ID and display name of a panel, including any child panels, for use in a stack of panels. It also includes special cosmetic cases to simplify the display name in certain situations."
