  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports two components: `PanelExpression` and `Spec`. The module imports the React library and a module called `Panel2` from a file located in the same directory. \n\nThe `PanelExpression` component is a functional component that takes in a single prop called `props`. The type of the `props` object is defined using the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel2` module. The `PanelProps` type is a generic type that takes in a type parameter, which in this case is `typeof inputType`. The `inputType` constant is defined as a string with the value `'any'`. Therefore, the `PanelExpression` component expects a prop object that conforms to the `PanelProps<'any'>` type.\n\nThe `PanelExpression` component returns an empty JSX element. It does not render any visible content, but it can be used as a placeholder component that can be replaced with other components that conform to the `PanelProps<'any'>` type.\n\nThe `Spec` object is an object that defines metadata about the `PanelExpression` component. It has four properties: `id`, `Component`, `inputType`, and `hidden`. The `id` property is a string that identifies the component. The `Component` property is a reference to the `PanelExpression` component. The `inputType` property is a reference to the `inputType` constant. The `hidden` property is a boolean that indicates whether the component should be hidden from the user interface.\n\nThis module can be used in a larger project that uses the `Panel2` module to define and render panels in a user interface. The `PanelExpression` component can be used as a placeholder component that can be replaced with other components that conform to the `PanelProps<'any'>` type. The `Spec` object can be used to define metadata about the `PanelExpression` component, such as its ID and whether it should be hidden from the user interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it related to `PanelExpression`?\n   - The smart developer might wonder what the `Panel2` module is and how it is used in relation to `PanelExpression`. The `Panel2` module is imported and used to define the `PanelExpressionProps` type, which is then used as a prop type for the `PanelExpression` component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `inputType` constant and how is it used?\n   - The smart developer might question the purpose of the `inputType` constant and how it is used. The `inputType` constant is used to define the type of input that the `PanelExpression` component expects, and is also used in the `Spec` object to specify the input type for the panel.\n\n3. Why is the `hidden` property set to `true` in the `Spec` object?\n   - The smart developer might be curious about the purpose of the `hidden` property in the `Spec` object. The `hidden` property is used to hide the panel from the user interface, indicating that it is not intended to be displayed to the user."
