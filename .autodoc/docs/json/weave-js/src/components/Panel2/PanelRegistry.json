  "summary": "The `weave` module is a collection of various panel specifications used in the larger project. The purpose of this module is to provide a centralized location for all the registered panels and converters. \n\nThe module imports various panel specifications from different files and stores them in an array called `panelSpecs`. The `initSpecs` function is used to lazily populate the `panelSpecs` array to avoid use-before-init when this module is loaded from one of the specs it contains. \n\nThe `PanelSpecs` function returns a copy of the `panelSpecs` array. This function is used to get all the registered panel specifications. \n\nThe `registerPanel` function is used to add a new panel to the registry. It takes a panel specification as an argument and adds it to the `panelSpecs` array. If a panel with the same ID already exists in the array, it updates the existing panel with the new specification. \n\nThe `ConverterSpecs` function returns an array of converter specifications. The `converterSpecs` array is lazily populated to avoid use-before-init when this module is loaded from one of the specs it contains. \n\nOverall, this module provides a centralized location for all the registered panels and converters used in the larger project. It allows for easy addition and updating of panels and converters. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { PanelSpecs, registerPanel } from 'weave';\n\n// Get all the registered panel specifications\nconst allPanels = PanelSpecs();\n\n// Add a new panel to the registry\nconst newPanel = {\n  id: 'my-panel',\n  title: 'My Panel',\n  ...\n};\nregisterPanel(newPanel);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weavePythonPanelSpecs` function?\n- The `weavePythonPanelSpecs` function is used to add additional panel specs to the `panelSpecs` array.\n\n2. What is the difference between `PanelSpecFunc` and `ConverterSpecArray`?\n- `PanelSpecFunc` is a function that returns an array of `PanelSpec` objects, while `ConverterSpecArray` is an array of `PanelConvertSpec` objects.\n\n3. How are new panels added to the registry?\n- New panels can be added to the registry by calling the `registerPanel` function and passing in a `PanelSpec` object. The function will add the new panel to the `panelSpecs` array if it doesn't already exist, or update an existing panel if it does."
