  "summary": "This file contains a list of panel specifications for the Weave Python project. The purpose of this code is to define the different types of panels that can be used in the Weave Python project. \n\nEach panel specification is imported from a separate file and added to an array using the `return` statement. The array is then exported as `weavePythonPanelSpecs`. \n\nThe panels listed in this file include `PanelAnyObj`, `PanelCard`, `PanelColor`, `PanelEachColumn`, `PanelFacetTabs`, `PanelFunctionEditor`, `PanelGpt3Model`, `PanelGroup`, `PanelLabeledItem`, `PanelLayoutFlow`, `PanelNewImage`, `PanelObjectPicker`, `PanelPanel`, `PanelPlotly`, `PanelQuery`, `PanelRef`, `RunSpec`, `PanelSections`, `PanelSlider`, `PanelStringEditor`, `PanelSelectEditor`, `PanelStringHistogramWeave`, `PanelTextEditor`, and `PanelWeaveLink`. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger Weave Python project to define the different types of panels that can be used in the user interface. For example, if a developer wants to add a new panel to the project, they can create a new panel specification file and import it into this file. Then, the new panel can be added to the `weavePythonPanelSpecs` array and used in the project. \n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in the Weave Python project:\n\n```\nimport {weavePythonPanelSpecs} from './weave';\n\nconst panels = weavePythonPanelSpecs();\n\n// Loop through the panels and create them in the user interface\nfor (let panel of panels) {\n  const panelInstance = new panel();\n  panelInstance.create();\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `weavePythonPanelSpecs` function is imported and called to get an array of panel specifications. Then, each panel is instantiated and added to the user interface using the `create` method.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file and what does it contain?\n- This file contains panel specifications specifically for Weave Python, and is not production ready.\n2. Why are some panels commented out?\n- The PanelAuto is commented out because it doesn't route config updates correctly and breaks stuff, and is not needed yet anyway.\n3. What is the output of the `weavePythonPanelSpecs` function?\n- The function returns an array of panel specifications for Weave Python."
