  "summary": "The `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component is a React functional component that renders a container for a list of columns. It takes in two props: `onDrop` and `visibleColumns`. `onDrop` is a function that is called when a drag-and-drop operation is completed on the container. `visibleColumns` is a boolean value that determines whether the container is visible or hidden.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `dragover` state, which is a boolean value that determines whether the container is currently being dragged over. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the container's DOM element.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with the `column-list-container` class. The class is conditionally modified based on the `dragover` and `visibleColumns` states. When the container is being dragged over, the `dragover` state is set to `true`, and the `dragover` class is added to the container. When the container is visible, the `visible-container` class is added, and when it is hidden, the `hidden-container` class is added.\n\nThe component also sets up event listeners for drag-and-drop events. When the container is dragged over, the `onDragStart` and `onDragEnter` events are triggered, and the `dragover` state is set to `true`. When the container is dragged out, the `onDragLeave` event is triggered, and the `dragover` state is set to `false`. The `onDragOver` event is necessary for the `onDrop` event to work, and it prevents the default behavior of the browser. When an item is dropped onto the container, the `onDrop` event is triggered, and the `onDrop` function is called. The function checks whether the item was dropped directly onto the container or one of its children and calls the `onDrop` function only if it was dropped directly onto the container.\n\nThe `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component is exported as the default export of the `weave` module. It can be used in other components to render a container for a list of columns that can be dragged and dropped. For example:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ColumnSelectorListContainer from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const handleDrop = () => {\n    console.log('Item dropped!');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ColumnSelectorListContainer onDrop={handleDrop} visibleColumns={true}>\n      <div>Column 1</div>\n      <div>Column 2</div>\n      <div>Column 3</div>\n    </ColumnSelectorListContainer>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component?\n- The `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component is a React functional component that renders a container for a list of columns and handles drag and drop events.\n\n2. What props does the `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component expect?\n- The `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component expects two props: `onDrop`, which is a function to be called when a drag and drop event is completed, and `visibleColumns`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the container should be visible or hidden.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useRef` and `useState` hooks used in this component?\n- The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the `div` element rendered by the component, which is used to check whether a drag and drop event is dropped on the container or one of its children. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `dragover` variable, which is used to determine whether the container is currently being dragged over."
