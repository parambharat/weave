  "summary": "The `weave` module is a collection of React components that allow users to create interactive data visualizations. The `Cell` and `Value` components are used to render individual cells and values in a table, respectively. \n\nThe `Cell` component takes in several props, including `table`, `inputNode`, `rowNode`, `selectFunction`, `colId`, `panelId`, `config`, `panelContext`, `simpleTable`, `updateTableState`, `updatePanelContext`, and `updateInput`. The `table` prop is an object that represents the state of the table, while `inputNode` and `rowNode` are objects that represent the input and row data for the cell, respectively. `selectFunction` is a function that selects a specific value from the input data, and `colId` and `panelId` are strings that identify the column and panel that the cell belongs to. `config` and `panelContext` are objects that contain configuration and context information for the panel, while `simpleTable` is a boolean that indicates whether the table is a simple table or not. `updateTableState`, `updatePanelContext`, and `updateInput` are functions that update the state of the table, panel context, and input data, respectively.\n\nThe `Value` component takes in several props, including `table`, `valueNode`, `config`, `panelContext`, `colId`, `updateTableState`, and `updatePanelContext`. The `table` prop is an object that represents the state of the table, while `valueNode` is an object that represents the value to be displayed in the cell. `config` and `panelContext` are objects that contain configuration and context information for the panel, while `colId` is a string that identifies the column that the cell belongs to. `updateTableState` and `updatePanelContext` are functions that update the state of the table and panel context, respectively.\n\nBoth components use the `useWeaveContext` and `useWeaveFeaturesContext` hooks to access the Weave context and features, respectively. They also use several other hooks and utility functions to manage state and render the appropriate content.\n\nOverall, these components are used to render interactive data visualizations in a table format, allowing users to select and manipulate specific values and view them in a panel. They are part of a larger project called Weave, which provides a suite of tools for data visualization and analysis.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` variable and where is it defined?\n- The `weave` variable is used to access the Weave context and is defined using the `useWeaveContext` hook from the `@wandb/weave/core` library.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `Cell` and `Value` components?\n- The `Cell` component is used to render a cell in a table, while the `Value` component is used to render a single value outside of a table.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ActionsTrigger` component and when is it used?\n- The `ActionsTrigger` component is used to wrap the `PanelComp2` component and trigger actions when the input node changes. It is used when `actionsEnabled` is true and the `simpleTable` prop is false."
