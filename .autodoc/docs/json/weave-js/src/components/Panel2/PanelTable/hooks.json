  "summary": "This code is a collection of utility functions and hooks used in the larger Weave project. \n\nThe `useUpdatePanelConfig` hook is used to update the configuration of a table column panel. It takes in three arguments: `updateTableState`, a function that updates the state of the table; `tableState`, the current state of the table; and `colId`, the ID of the column to update. It returns a memoized callback function that updates the table state with the new panel configuration and records an event using the `makeEventRecorder` function.\n\nThe `makePromiseUsable` function takes in a promise function and returns a new function that returns a `Loadable` object. The `Loadable` object is either an object with a `loading` property set to `true` and a `result` property set to `undefined`, or an object with a `loading` property set to `false` and a `result` property set to the result of the promise function. The returned function is memoized and updates when new arguments or new promise results come in.\n\nThe `vectorizePromiseFn` function takes in a promise function and returns a new function that takes in an array of arguments and returns a promise that resolves to an array of results. This is useful for running a promise function on a list of arguments.\n\nThe `refineExpression` and `refineExpressions` functions are used to refine editing nodes in the Weave project. `refineExpression` takes in an editing node, a stack, and a Weave interface, and returns a promise that resolves to the refined editing node. `refineExpressions` is a vectorized version of `refineExpression` that takes in an array of editing nodes and returns a promise that resolves to an array of refined editing nodes.\n\nOverall, these functions and hooks are used to simplify and streamline various tasks in the Weave project, such as updating table configurations and refining editing nodes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useUpdatePanelConfig` function?\n- The `useUpdatePanelConfig` function returns a memoized callback function that updates the table state with a new panel configuration for a specified column ID, and records an event with the name `UPDATE_PANEL_CONFIG`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `makePromiseUsable` function?\n- The `makePromiseUsable` function takes a promise function as input and returns a new function that returns a loadable object with the result of the promise function. The loadable object has a `loading` property that indicates whether the promise is still pending, and a `result` property that contains the result of the promise if it has resolved.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `refineExpressions` function?\n- The `refineExpressions` function takes a list of expressions and a stack as input, and returns a promise that resolves to a list of refined expressions. The `refineExpression` function is called for each expression in the list, and the results are combined into a single list using `Promise.all`."
