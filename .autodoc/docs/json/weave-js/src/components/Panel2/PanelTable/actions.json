  "summary": "The `TableActions` function in the `weave` project is responsible for generating an array of actions that can be performed on a table. The function takes in three arguments: `weave`, `filterFn`, and `setFilterFn`. `weave` is an object that provides an interface to the `weave` library, `filterFn` is a function that filters the table, and `setFilterFn` is a function that sets the filter.\n\nThe function returns an array of two objects, each representing an action that can be performed on the table. The first action is \"Filter: Only this value\", which filters the table to show only rows that match a specific value. The second action is \"Filter: Exclude this value\", which filters the table to exclude rows that match a specific value.\n\nBoth actions have a `name`, `icon`, `detail`, `isAvailable`, and `doAction` property. The `name` and `icon` properties are self-explanatory. The `detail` property is a function that returns a string that describes the action being performed. The `isAvailable` property is a function that determines whether the action is available for a given node. The `doAction` property is a function that performs the action.\n\nThe `isFilterableNode` function is used to determine whether a node is filterable. A node is filterable if its type is assignable to `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. The `detail` function uses the `weave` library to query the value of a node and returns a string that describes the action being performed. The `doAction` function uses the `weave` library to query the value of a node and sets the filter function accordingly.\n\nOverall, the `TableActions` function provides a way to filter a table based on specific values. This can be useful for exploring large datasets and finding patterns in the data. Here is an example of how the `TableActions` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Weave } from '@wandb/weave';\nimport { TableActions } from 'weave';\n\nconst weave = new Weave();\nconst filterFn = null;\nconst setFilterFn = (filter) => {\n  console.log(filter);\n};\n\nconst actions = TableActions(weave, filterFn, setFilterFn);\nconsole.log(actions);\n```\n\nThis will output an array of two objects representing the \"Filter: Only this value\" and \"Filter: Exclude this value\" actions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports an array of two objects that define actions for filtering table data in a Weave interface.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports several functions and types from the `@wandb/weave/core` module and the `NodeAction` type from a file located in a `../../../actions` directory.\n\n3. What are the inputs and outputs of the `TableActions` function?\n- The `TableActions` function takes in three parameters: a `WeaveInterface` object, a `NodeOrVoidNode` filter function, and a function to set the filter function. It returns an array of two `NodeAction` objects that define the behavior of the filter actions."
