  "summary": "The code above defines a styled component called `FlexContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The purpose of this component is to create a flexible container that can be used to display content in a flexible and responsive manner. \n\nThe `FlexContainer` component is defined as a `div` element with the following CSS properties: `display: flex`, `justify-content: start`, `width: 100%`, and `height: 100%`. \n\nThe `display: flex` property allows the container to be flexible and adjust its content based on the available space. The `justify-content: start` property aligns the content to the left of the container. The `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` properties ensure that the container takes up the full width and height of its parent element.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to create flexible and responsive layouts. For example, it can be used to create a navigation bar that adjusts its size and position based on the screen size. \n\nHere is an example of how the `FlexContainer` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { FlexContainer } from 'weave';\n\nconst NavigationBar = () => {\n  return (\n    <FlexContainer>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Home</li>\n        <li>About</li>\n        <li>Contact</li>\n      </ul>\n    </FlexContainer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default NavigationBar;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FlexContainer` component is used to create a flexible container for a navigation bar. The `ul` element containing the navigation links is placed inside the `FlexContainer`. The `FlexContainer` adjusts its size and position based on the available space, allowing the navigation bar to be displayed in a flexible and responsive manner.",
