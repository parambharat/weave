  "summary": "The code above is defining a `Spec` object that is used to specify a panel in the larger `weave` project. The `Spec` object has four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. \n\nThe `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the panel. In this case, the `id` is set to `'dir'`. \n\nThe `displayName` property is a string that is used to display the name of the panel in the user interface. In this case, the `displayName` is set to `'Directory'`. \n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that is used to render the panel. In this case, the `Component` is set to a lazy-loaded component that is imported from the `'./Component'` file. This means that the component will only be loaded when it is actually needed, which can help improve performance. \n\nThe `inputType` property is an object that specifies the input type for the panel. The `inputType` object is imported from the `'./common'` file. \n\nOverall, this code is defining a panel specification that can be used in the larger `weave` project. The `Spec` object specifies the unique identifier, display name, and React component for the panel, as well as the input type. This allows the panel to be easily added to the larger project and used in the user interface. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave';\n\nconst myPanelSpec = {\n  ...Spec,\n  id: 'my-panel',\n  displayName: 'My Panel',\n  Component: MyPanelComponent,\n  inputType: { type: 'text' },\n};\n\n// Add the panel to the project\nweave.addPanel(myPanelSpec);\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `Panel2` import is likely a module or component from a separate file, and it is being used to define the type of the `Spec` object as a `PanelSpec`.\n2. What is the significance of the `React.lazy` function being used to import the `Component`?\n   - The `React.lazy` function is used to lazily load the `Component` module, which means it will only be loaded when it is actually needed, potentially improving performance.\n3. What is the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The `inputType` variable is likely a constant or function defined in the `common` module, which is being imported using a relative path. Its purpose is not clear from this code snippet alone."
