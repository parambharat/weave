  "summary": "The `PanelAuto` component is a React functional component that renders a child component called `ChildPanel`. It takes in a set of props of type `PanelAutoProps`, which is defined as a type alias for `Panel2.PanelProps<typeof inputType>`. \n\nThe `PanelAuto` component is not currently being used in the codebase, as all of its code is commented out. However, it appears that it was intended to be used as a panel component in the larger `weave` project. \n\nThe `Spec` object exports a `PanelSpec` object that defines the properties of the `PanelAuto` component. It has a `hidden` property that is set to `false`, an `id` property that is set to `'Auto'`, a `Component` property that is set to the `PanelAuto` component, and an `inputType` property that is set to `'any'` as a constant. \n\nThe `ChildPanel` component that is being rendered by `PanelAuto` is imported from a file called `ChildPanel`, and the `Panel2` module is imported and aliased as `Panel2`. It is unclear what the `Panel2` module contains, as it is not shown in the code snippet provided. \n\nThere are several commented-out lines of code that suggest that the `PanelAuto` component was intended to use the `weave` context and other custom hooks from the `weave` project. However, without more information about the `weave` project and its context and hooks, it is difficult to determine the exact purpose and functionality of this component. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {PanelAuto} from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const config = { /* some configuration object */ };\n  const updateConfig = (newConfig) => { /* update configuration */ };\n  const updateConfig2 = (newConfig) => { /* update configuration */ };\n\n  return (\n    <PanelAuto\n      input={config}\n      updateConfig={updateConfig}\n      updateConfig2={updateConfig2}\n    />\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelAuto` component?\n- The `PanelAuto` component is a functional component that renders a `ChildPanel` component with some props passed down to it.\n\n2. What is the `inputType` variable used for?\n- The `inputType` variable is a constant that is assigned the value `'any'` and is used as a type argument for the `PanelProps` type of the `Panel2` module.\n\n3. Why are some lines of code commented out in the `PanelAuto` component?\n- Some lines of code are commented out in the `PanelAuto` component because they are not currently being used, but may have been used in previous versions of the code or may be used in future versions."
