  "summary": "The `PanelAudio` component is a React functional component that renders an audio player for a given audio file. It imports several dependencies, including `downloadjs`, `react`, `react-virtualized`, `AudioViewer`, `Panel2`, and `useAssetURLFromArtifact`. \n\nThe `PanelAudio` component takes in a single prop, `input`, which is of type `PanelAudioProps`. `PanelAudioProps` is defined as an object with properties that match the `inputType` object. `inputType` is imported from a `common` file and defines the expected input for this component.\n\nThe `PanelAudio` component uses the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook to retrieve the URL for the audio file. If the URL is successfully retrieved, the component renders an `AudioViewer` component that displays the audio player. If the URL cannot be retrieved, an error message is logged to the console.\n\nThe `AudioViewer` component takes in several props, including `audioSrc`, which is the URL for the audio file, `caption`, which is a string that describes the audio file, `height`, which is the height of the audio player, `mediaFailedToLoad`, which is a boolean that indicates whether the media failed to load, and `downloadFile`, which is a function that downloads the audio file.\n\nThe `PanelAudio` component also renders an `AutoSizer` component from `react-virtualized`, which automatically resizes the `AudioViewer` component based on the dimensions of its parent container.\n\nOverall, the `PanelAudio` component provides a simple way to render an audio player for a given audio file. It can be used in conjunction with other components in the `weave` project to create a more complex user interface for displaying and interacting with audio files. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport PanelAudio from 'weave/PanelAudio';\n\nconst MyAudioComponent = () => {\n  const audioInput = {url: 'https://example.com/audio.mp3', caption: 'My Audio File'};\n  return (\n    <PanelAudio input={audioInput} />\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on the `downloadjs` and `react-virtualized` packages.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `PanelAudio` component?\n- The `PanelAudio` component is a React functional component that renders an `AudioViewer` component with the audio source and caption obtained from an input node, and allows the user to download the audio file.\n\n3. What is the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook doing?\n- The `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook is retrieving the URL and caption of an audio asset from an input node, and returning an object with the asset information and a loading flag."
