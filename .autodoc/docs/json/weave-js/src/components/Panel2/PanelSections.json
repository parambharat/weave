  "summary": "The `weave` project contains a file that exports a React component called `PanelSections`. This component is used to render a list of sections, where each section is a `ChildPanel` component with its own configuration. The `PanelSections` component takes in a list of items as input, and groups them into sections based on a provided expression. \n\nThe `PanelSections` component is composed of several sub-components, including `PanelSectionsConfigComp`, which is responsible for rendering the configuration options for the `PanelSections` component, and `Section`, which is responsible for rendering each individual section. \n\nThe `PanelSectionsConfigComp` component renders a form that allows the user to configure the `PanelSections` component. The form includes options for configuring the section expression and the child panel configuration. The `Section` component renders a single section, which consists of a `ChildPanel` component with its own configuration. \n\nThe `PanelSections` component groups the input items into sections based on the provided section expression. Each section is then rendered using the `Section` component, which renders a `ChildPanel` component with its own configuration. \n\nOverall, the `PanelSections` component is a flexible way to group and display a list of items in a dashboard or other UI. It allows the user to configure the section expression and child panel configuration, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport {PanelSections} from 'weave';\n\nconst items = [\n  {name: 'Item 1', category: 'Category A'},\n  {name: 'Item 2', category: 'Category B'},\n  {name: 'Item 3', category: 'Category A'},\n  {name: 'Item 4', category: 'Category B'},\n];\n\nconst sectionExpr = opGroupGroupKey({obj: varNode({type: 'list', objectType: 'any'}, 'item.category')});\n\nconst childPanelConfig = {\n  id: 'MyChildPanel',\n  input_node: varNode({type: 'list', objectType: 'any'}, 'item'),\n  config: undefined,\n  vars: {},\n};\n\n<PanelSections input={items} config={{section: sectionExpr, panel: childPanelConfig}} />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `usePanelSectionsCommon` hook?\n- The `usePanelSectionsCommon` hook is used to provide common functionality to the `PanelSectionsConfigComp` and `PanelSections` components, such as updating the configuration and section expressions.\n\n2. What is the `PanelSections` component rendering?\n- The `PanelSections` component is rendering a list of `Section` components, each of which contains a `ChildPanel` component and a section name.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `PANEL_SECTIONS_DEFAULT_CONFIG` object?\n- The `PANEL_SECTIONS_DEFAULT_CONFIG` object provides default values for the `section` and `panel` properties of the `PanelSectionsConfig` type."
