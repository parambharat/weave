  "summary": "The `PanelWeaveLink` module is a React component that creates clickable links that update the root expression. The component takes a `to` configuration field, which is a Weave expression node. The `to` expression node is evaluated, and any variables present in the expression are passed in as constants. For example, if the `to` expression is `model(input)`, where `input` is a variable that represents `PanelLink`'s input node, `PanelLink` will evaluate the input node and pass the result in place of the variable. So if `input` evaluates to `'x'`, when clicked, the root expression will change to `model('x')`.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component is used in the larger project to create clickable links that update the root expression. The component is styled using `styled-components` and takes a `PanelProps` object as input. The `PanelProps` object contains an `input` field, which is of type `any`, and a `config` field, which is of type `WeaveLinkConfig`. The `WeaveLinkConfig` type contains a `to` field, which is a `NodeOrVoidNode`, and a `vars` field, which is a `Frame`.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component uses the `useWeaveContext` and `usePanelContext` hooks to get the Weave context and panel context, respectively. The component then evaluates the `to` expression node and passes in any variables present in the expression as constants. The component also finds all variables in the `to` expression and uses them as template variables. The evaluated variable results are then passed back into the `to` expression as const nodes.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component is exported along with a `Spec` object that contains the component's specifications. The `Spec` object is used to create a hidden panel that can be used to create clickable links that update the root expression.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `to` field in the `WeaveLinkConfig` interface?\n   \n   The `to` field is a Weave expression Node that represents the destination of the link. Any variables present in the expression will be evaluated and passed into the expression as consts.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `vars` field in the `WeaveLinkConfig` interface?\n   \n   The `vars` field is a Frame that contains variables that are used as template variables in the `to` expression. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `updateChildPanelConfig` function in the `PanelWeaveLink` component?\n   \n   The `updateChildPanelConfig` function is currently not supported and will log a warning if called."
