  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports two components, `PanelLink` and `Spec`, which are used to display a link in a panel. The `PanelLink` component is a functional React component that takes in a `PanelLinkProps` object as its props. The `PanelLinkProps` type is defined as a type alias of `PanelProps<typeof inputType>`, where `inputType` is an object that defines the type of the input that the panel expects. The `PanelLink` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to get the value of the input, which is expected to be a link. If the value is still loading, the component returns a div with a dash (-) character. Otherwise, it extracts the name and URL of the link from the query result and truncates the name to a maximum length of 100 characters. Finally, it renders a `Link` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/util/links` module, passing in the URL and truncated name as its children.\n\nThe `Spec` object is an object that defines the specification of the panel. It has an `id` property that identifies the panel as a link panel, a `Component` property that specifies the `PanelLink` component as the component to be used to render the panel, and an `inputType` property that specifies the type of the input that the panel expects.\n\nThis module can be used in a larger project that requires the display of links in a panel. The `PanelLink` component can be used as is, or it can be customized to fit the specific requirements of the project. The `Spec` object can be used to register the link panel with the project's panel registry, allowing it to be used in the project's UI. For example, the following code registers the link panel with the project's panel registry:\n\n```\nimport {PanelRegistry} from 'project/panel-registry';\nimport {Spec} from 'weave/link-panel';\n\nPanelRegistry.register(Spec);\n```\n\nOnce registered, the link panel can be used in the project's UI by specifying the `id` of the panel in the configuration of a dashboard or report. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"dashboard\",\n  \"layout\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"row\",\n      \"panels\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"link\",\n          \"input\": \"https://example.com\",\n          \"title\": \"Example Link\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PanelLink` component?\n   - The `PanelLink` component is used to render a link within a panel, with the link's display text truncated if it exceeds a certain length.\n2. What is the `inputType` object used for?\n   - The `inputType` object defines a union type with two members, `'none'` and `'link'`, which is used to specify the type of input expected by the `PanelLink` component.\n3. What is the `Spec` object used for?\n   - The `Spec` object defines the specifications for the `PanelLink` panel, including its ID, the component to be rendered, and the expected input type."
