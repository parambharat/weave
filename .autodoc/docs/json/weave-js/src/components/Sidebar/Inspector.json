  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Inspector` that takes in two props: `active` and `children`. The `active` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not the component is active, and the `children` prop is any content that should be displayed within the component. The component is exported as both a named export and a default export.\n\nThe `Container` and `Content` styled components are also defined in this file. The `Container` component is a styled `div` that takes in an `active` prop and sets various CSS properties based on its value. If `active` is `true`, the component will have a left border of 1 pixel solid `#e5e5e5` and a width of `WIDTH_PX` pixels. If `active` is `false`, the component will have no left border and a width of 0 pixels. The `Content` component is a styled `div` that has a fixed width of `WIDTH_PX` pixels and a height of 100%.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to create a sidebar or inspector component that can be toggled on and off. The `active` prop can be controlled by a parent component to show or hide the `Inspector` component. The `children` prop can be used to pass in any content that should be displayed within the `Inspector`. For example, if the `Inspector` component is used to display information about a selected item, the `children` prop could be used to pass in details about that item.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Inspector` component could be used in a parent component:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Inspector from './Inspector';\n\nconst ParentComponent = () => {\n  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    setIsActive(!isActive);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Toggle Inspector</button>\n      <Inspector active={isActive}>\n        <p>Details about the selected item:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Name: Item 1</li>\n          <li>Price: $10</li>\n          <li>Description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </Inspector>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Inspector` component?\n- The `Inspector` component is a functional component that takes in an `active` boolean prop and `children` prop, and returns a `Container` component with the `active` prop and `Content` component as its children.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Container` styled component?\n- The `Container` styled component is a div that has a `flex-shrink` property of 0, a font size of 15px, and an overflow of hidden. It also has a border-left of 1px solid #e5e5e5 if the `active` prop is true, and a width of 0px if the `active` prop is false. If the `active` prop is true, the width is set to 328px. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Content` styled component?\n- The `Content` styled component is a div that has a fixed width of 328px and a height of 100%. It is a child component of the `Container` component."
