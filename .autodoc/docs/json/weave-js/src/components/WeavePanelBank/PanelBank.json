  "summary": "This code is a Less (Leaner Style Sheets) file that defines the styles for the \"PanelBank\" component in the Weave project. The PanelBank component is a part of the user interface that displays a collection of panels, each containing visualizations or other content. The styles defined in this file control the appearance and behavior of the PanelBank and its child components, such as panel actions, search input, and pagination controls.\n\nThe file starts by importing global styles and the styles for the \"PanelBankEditablePanel\" component. It then defines several variables for dimensions, such as `@panelSectionActionWidth` and `@panelBankWithRunsOffset`.\n\nThe main styles are scoped under the `.weave-root` class to avoid conflicts with other W&B PanelBank styles. The code defines styles for various elements, such as dropdown menus, panel actions, empty watermarks, and panel media. It also includes styles for the panel bank's search input, action buttons, and section titles.\n\nThe code also defines styles for the \"flow-section\" and \"grid-section\" components, which are used to display panels in different layouts. These styles control the appearance of the panels, their resizing handles, and the behavior when panels are being dragged or resized.\n\nAdditionally, the code includes media queries to adjust the styles for different screen sizes, such as tablet and mobile devices. This ensures that the PanelBank component remains responsive and user-friendly on various devices.\n\nIn summary, this Less file provides the styles for the PanelBank component in the Weave project, ensuring a consistent and responsive appearance across different devices and screen sizes. The styles defined here control the layout, appearance, and behavior of the panels and their associated actions, search input, and other elements.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `weave-root` class and how does it affect the styling of the PanelBank?\n   **Answer**: The `weave-root` class is used to scope the styles defined in this file so that they don't interfere with the W&B PanelBank styles. It ensures that the styles defined within the `weave-root` class are only applied to elements within the Weave project and not to the W&B core PanelBank.\n\n2. **Question**: What are the different media queries used in this file and how do they affect the layout and styling of the elements?\n   **Answer**: There are three media queries used in this file: one for screens with a width between 1201px and 1440px, one for screens with a width between the `tabletBreakpoint` and 1200px, and one for screens with a width less than or equal to the `tabletBreakpoint`. These media queries adjust the layout and styling of elements such as the panel bank section title, search input, and action buttons to better fit the available screen space.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `read-only` class and how does it affect the PanelBank?\n   **Answer**: The `read-only` class is used to modify the behavior and appearance of the PanelBank when it is in a read-only mode. When the `read-only` class is applied, the resizable handles for the panels are hidden, preventing users from resizing the panels in the PanelBank."
