  "summary": "The `weave` project contains a file that exports several functions and components. The `scrollIntoBounds` function takes in a DOMRect object, which represents the size and position of an element, and two numbers representing the minimum space from the top and bottom of the viewport. If the top or bottom of the element is outside of the viewport by more than the specified minimum space, the function scrolls the window so that the element is within bounds.\n\nThe `flashFocus` function takes in an element and an options object, which can contain various properties such as width, height, padding, and borderRadius. The function creates a new div element with the class name \"focuser\" and positions it over the specified element. The \"focuser\" div dims the rest of the screen and highlights the specified element. The function also scrolls the window to ensure that the element is within bounds. If the popping property in the options object is set to true, the function adds an event listener to the specified element that removes the \"popping\" class from the \"focuser\" div when the element is clicked.\n\nThe `EmptyVisualizations` component takes in an object with optional headerText and helpText properties. The component returns a div element with the text \"EMPTY\". This component is likely a placeholder for a more complex visualization component.\n\nThe `EmptyPanelBankSectionWatermark` component returns an instance of the `EmptyVisualizations` component with specific header and help text. This component is likely used to display a message when there are no visualizations in a panel bank section.\n\nOverall, these functions and components are likely used to enhance the user experience of the `weave` project by providing visual cues and feedback to the user. The `scrollIntoBounds` function ensures that the user can see the specified element, while the `flashFocus` function highlights the element and dims the rest of the screen. The `EmptyVisualizations` and `EmptyPanelBankSectionWatermark` components provide informative messages to the user when there is no data to display.",
  "questions": "1. What does the `flashFocus` function do?\n- The `flashFocus` function dims the whole screen except for a specified element and adds a focus box around it with customizable options such as width, height, padding, and border radius.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `EmptyVisualizations` component?\n- The `EmptyVisualizations` component is used to display a message when there are no visualizations to show. It takes in optional props for header text and help text.\n\n3. What is the `EmptyPanelBankSectionWatermark` component?\n- The `EmptyPanelBankSectionWatermark` component is a specific implementation of the `EmptyVisualizations` component with pre-defined header and help text. It is used to display a message when there are no visualizations in a panel bank section."
