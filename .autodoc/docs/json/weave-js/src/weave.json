  "summary": "The code is importing two modules, `Client` and `Weave`, from the `@wandb/weave/core` package, as well as a `PanelSpec` interface from a local file. It then defines a class called `WeaveApp` that extends the `Weave` class. The `WeaveApp` class has a constructor that takes a `Client` object as an argument and passes it to the `Weave` constructor using the `super` keyword. It also initializes an empty array called `panelSpecs`.\n\nThe `WeaveApp` class has a single method called `panel` that takes a string argument called `id`. This method searches the `panelSpecs` array for an object with an `id` property that matches the `id` argument. If it finds a match, it returns the object. If it doesn't find a match, it throws an error.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to create a `Weave` application with a set of `PanelSpec` objects that can be accessed by their `id` values. The `Weave` class provides a framework for building interactive visualizations, and the `PanelSpec` interface defines the properties of a panel that can be added to a `Weave` application. The `WeaveApp` class extends the `Weave` class and adds a method for retrieving a `PanelSpec` object by its `id`. This can be useful for dynamically updating the contents of a panel based on user input or other events.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport {Client} from '@wandb/weave/core';\nimport {WeaveApp} from './weave-app';\nimport {PanelSpec} from './components/Panel2/panel';\n\nconst client = new Client();\nconst weaveApp = new WeaveApp(client);\n\nconst panelSpecs: PanelSpec[] = [\n  {id: 'panel1', title: 'Panel 1', content: 'This is the content of panel 1'},\n  {id: 'panel2', title: 'Panel 2', content: 'This is the content of panel 2'},\n  {id: 'panel3', title: 'Panel 3', content: 'This is the content of panel 3'},\n];\n\nweaveApp.panelSpecs = panelSpecs;\n\nconst panel1 = weaveApp.panel('panel1');\nconsole.log(panel1.title); // Output: \"Panel 1\"\n\nconst panel2 = weaveApp.panel('panel2');\nconsole.log(panel2.content); // Output: \"This is the content of panel 2\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `Client` object and use it to create a `WeaveApp` object. We then define an array of `PanelSpec` objects and assign it to the `panelSpecs` property of the `WeaveApp` object. Finally, we use the `panel` method of the `WeaveApp` object to retrieve individual `PanelSpec` objects by their `id` values and log their properties to the console. This demonstrates how the `WeaveApp` class can be used to manage a set of `PanelSpec` objects in a `Weave` application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Weave` and `Client` imports from `@wandb/weave/core`?\n   - The `Weave` import is a class that is being extended by the `WeaveApp` class, and the `Client` import is being passed as a parameter to the `WeaveApp` constructor.\n2. What is the `panelSpecs` property and how is it being used?\n   - `panelSpecs` is an array of `PanelSpec` objects that is being initialized in the `WeaveApp` constructor and used in the `panel` method to find a panel with a specific ID.\n3. Why is there a TODO comment about moving an implementation to the `cg` package?\n   - It is unclear from the code snippet what the `cg` package is and what implementation is being referred to, so a smart developer might want to investigate further or consult with other team members to understand the context and reasoning behind the comment."
