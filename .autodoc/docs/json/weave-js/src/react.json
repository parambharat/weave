  "summary": "This code file is part of a React-based project that uses the Weave compute graph library. It provides a set of hooks and utility functions to interact with Weave nodes and their values, allowing developers to easily integrate Weave into their React applications.\n\nThe `ReactCGEventTracker` class is used to track the number of calls to the `useNodeValue` hook. The `useNodeValue` hook is a core part of this file, allowing developers to get the value of a Weave node. It takes a node and an optional memoCacheId, and returns an object with a `loading` boolean and a `result` containing the evaluated value of the node.\n\nThe `useClientContext` hook returns the current client context, which is used in various other hooks and functions in this file. The `useNodeValueExecutor` hook returns a function that can be used to retrieve the value of a node as a promise, useful for conditional evaluations.\n\nThe `useValue` hook wraps `useNodeValue` and adds a `refresh` method to force a re-evaluation of the node. The `useEach` hook is used to work with array nodes, returning a set of nodes for each item in the array.\n\nThe `useMutation` hook allows developers to create and execute mutations on Weave nodes. It takes a target node, an action name, and an optional callback to handle root updates. The `useRefreshAllNodes` hook returns a function that can be used to refresh all nodes in the compute graph.\n\nThe `useExpandedNode` and `useSimplifiedNode` hooks are used to work with expanded and simplified versions of nodes, respectively. The `useRefEqualExpr` hook returns a reference-equal expression for a given node and stack.\n\nThe `useNodeDebugInfo` hook is a debugging utility that returns detailed information about a given node, including its refined version, value, inputs, and any invalidators. This hook is inefficient and should only be used for debugging purposes.",
  "questions": "1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `ReactCGEventTracker` class and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `ReactCGEventTracker` class is used to track the number of calls to the `useNodeValue` function. It has methods to reset the count and provide a summary of the tracked events. It is used in the code to create a global instance called `GlobalCGReactTracker` which is used to track the events throughout the code.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `useNodeValue` hook and what does it return?\n   **Answer**: The `useNodeValue` hook is a React hook-style function that evaluates a given Weave CG node and returns an object containing a `loading` boolean and a `result` of the evaluated node. The `loading` boolean indicates whether the evaluation is still in progress, and the `result` contains the evaluated value of the node.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `useMutation` hook and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `useMutation` hook is used to create a mutation function for a given target node and action name. It takes care of refreshing all nodes after the mutation is performed and handles root updates if provided. The hook returns a function that can be called with the required inputs to perform the mutation."
