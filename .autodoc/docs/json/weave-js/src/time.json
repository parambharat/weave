  "summary": "The `weave` module contains various utility functions and constants related to time and date calculations. \n\nThe module exports several constants, including `SECONDS_IN_MINUTE`, `MINUTES_IN_HOUR`, `HOURS_IN_DAY`, `DAYS_IN_WEEK`, `DAYS_IN_YEAR`, and `WEEKS_IN_YEAR`, which represent the number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks in a minute, hour, day, week, and year, respectively. \n\nThe module also exports several other constants, including `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`, `DAY`, `WEEK`, and `YEAR`, which represent the number of milliseconds in a second, minute, hour, day, week, and year, respectively. \n\nThe module exports several functions, including `secondsToHours`, `millisecondsToDays`, and `hoursToSeconds`, which convert between different units of time. \n\nThe module also exports a `TimeDelta` class, which represents a duration of time in terms of seconds, minutes, hours, and days. The class has several methods, including `toSingleUnitString`, `toHoursString`, and `toDHMSString`, which return a string representation of the duration in different formats. \n\nThe module also exports several other functions, including `monthRoundedTime`, `formatDurationWithColons`, `formatDurationWithLetters`, `unixTimestampMSFromUTCString`, `DateFromUTCString`, `addUTCTimezoneIfNotPresent`, `addDays`, `diffInMilliseconds`, `diffInDays`, and `getTimeSegmentsInTimeZone`, which perform various time and date calculations and manipulations. \n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides a comprehensive set of utilities for working with time and date calculations in JavaScript. It can be used in a variety of projects that require time and date calculations, such as scheduling applications, analytics dashboards, and more. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { secondsToHours, TimeDelta } from 'weave';\n\nconst hours = secondsToHours(3600); // returns 1\n\nconst delta = new TimeDelta(86400);\nconst hoursString = delta.toHoursString(); // returns \"1 day\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What are the units used in the `monthRoundedTime` function and how are they calculated?\n- The function uses convenient units in seconds for minute, hour, day, and month.\n- The values for these units are calculated by multiplying the number of seconds in a minute, hour, day, and month by their respective amounts.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `TimeDelta` class and its methods?\n- The `TimeDelta` class represents a duration of time in seconds and provides methods to convert it to a string representation in various formats.\n- The `toSingleUnitString` method returns an approximate string using the largest unit that would have a non-zero value.\n- The `toHoursString` method returns the duration in hours with two decimal places.\n- The `toDHMSString` method returns the duration in the format Ddays HH:mm:ss.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getTimeSegmentsInTimeZone` function and how does it work?\n- The function returns an object with the current hour, minute, and second in a specified time zone.\n- It uses the `toLocaleTimeString` method with the specified time zone and options to format the current time in that time zone, and then parses the resulting string to extract the hour, minute, and second."
