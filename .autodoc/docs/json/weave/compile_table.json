  "summary": "The code in this file provides functions for optimizing table access sub-DAGs in the larger project called \"weave\". The main purpose of this code is to merge two trees of accessed columns and return a tree of all accessed columns. \n\nThe `tree_merge` function takes two trees as input and merges the second tree (`b`) into the first tree (`a`) in place. It does this by iterating through the items in `b` and checking if the value is a dictionary. If it is, it recursively calls `tree_merge` on the corresponding values in `a` and `b`. If it is not a dictionary, it sets the value in `a` to the value in `b`.\n\nThe `get_projection` function takes an object returned by the `stitch` module and returns a tree of all accessed columns. It does this by iterating through the calls in the object and checking if the call is a \"pick\" or \"__getattr__\" call. If it is, it extracts the key and recursively calls `get_projection` on the output of the call. If the call is a \"keytypes\" call, it sets a flag to indicate that all keys are being accessed. Otherwise, it recursively calls `get_projection` on the output of the call. Finally, if the flag for all keys is set, it returns an empty tree.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to optimize table access sub-DAGs by merging trees of accessed columns. For example, if there are two sub-DAGs that access different columns of the same table, the trees of accessed columns for each sub-DAG can be merged to reduce the number of table accesses. \n\nCode example:\n\n```\nfrom weave import optimize\n\n# create two trees of accessed columns\ntree1 = {\"table1\": {\"col1\": {}, \"col2\": {}}}\ntree2 = {\"table1\": {\"col3\": {}, \"col4\": {}}}\n\n# merge the trees\noptimize.tree_merge(tree1, tree2)\n\n# tree1 now contains all accessed columns\nprint(tree1)  # {\"table1\": {\"col1\": {}, \"col2\": {}, \"col3\": {}, \"col4\": {}}}\n\n# get the tree of accessed columns for an object returned by stitch\nobj = stitch.get_object()\nprojection = optimize.get_projection(obj)\nprint(projection)  # {\"table1\": {\"col1\": {}, \"col2\": {}, \"col3\": {}, \"col4\": {}}}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `KeyTree` type and how is it used in this code?\n- The `KeyTree` type is a dictionary with string keys and values that are also `KeyTree` dictionaries. It is used to represent a tree structure of accessed columns in `get_projection` function.\n\n2. What does the `tree_merge` function do and how is it used in this code?\n- The `tree_merge` function merges two `KeyTree` dictionaries, with the second one (`b`) being merged into the first one (`a`) in place. It is used in the `get_projection` function to merge the accessed columns of each call output into a single `KeyTree` dictionary.\n\n3. What happens if a `call` in the `get_projection` function has a `key` value of `None`?\n- If a `call` in the `get_projection` function has a `key` value of `None`, it raises a `WeaveInternalError` with the message \"non-const not yet supported\"."
