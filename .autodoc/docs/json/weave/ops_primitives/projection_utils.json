  "summary": "This code provides functionality for performing 2D projections of high-dimensional embeddings using various algorithms. The purpose of this code is to allow for visualizations of embeddings in 2D space, which can be useful for understanding relationships between data points. \n\nThe `perform_2D_projection` function takes in a numpy array of embeddings, a string indicating which projection algorithm to use, and a dictionary of options for the chosen algorithm. It returns a numpy array of the projected embeddings in 2D space. The function first checks that the input numpy array is 2D, and then calls the appropriate projection function based on the input algorithm string. If the input algorithm is not recognized, an exception is raised. \n\nThe `limit_embedding_dimensions` function takes in a numpy array of embeddings and an integer indicating the maximum number of dimensions to keep. If the input numpy array has more dimensions than the maximum allowed, the function performs PCA to reduce the number of dimensions to the maximum. Otherwise, the function simply returns the input numpy array. \n\nThe `perform_2D_projection_pca` function takes in a numpy array of embeddings and a dictionary of options. It performs PCA on the input embeddings to reduce the number of dimensions to 2, and returns the resulting 2D projection. \n\nThe `perform_2D_projection_tsne` function takes in a numpy array of embeddings and a dictionary of options. It performs t-SNE on the input embeddings to reduce the number of dimensions to 2, and returns the resulting 2D projection. The function uses the `limit_embedding_dimensions` function to reduce the number of dimensions of the input embeddings before performing t-SNE. \n\nThe `perform_2D_projection_umap` function takes in a numpy array of embeddings and a dictionary of options. It performs UMAP on the input embeddings to reduce the number of dimensions to 2, and returns the resulting 2D projection. The function uses a cached version of the UMAP library to perform the projection. UMAP is not thread-safe, so the function uses a lock to ensure that only one thread is accessing the UMAP library at a time. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful set of functions for performing 2D projections of high-dimensional embeddings using various algorithms. These functions can be used in the larger project to provide visualizations of embeddings in 2D space, which can help with understanding relationships between data points. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom weave import perform_2D_projection\n\n# create a numpy array of embeddings\nembeddings = np.random.rand(100, 50)\n\n# perform PCA projection\nprojection = perform_2D_projection(embeddings, \"pca\", {\"pca\": {}})\n\n# perform t-SNE projection\nprojection = perform_2D_projection(embeddings, \"tsne\", {\"tsne\": {\"perplexity\": 50, \"iterations\": 500}})\n\n# perform UMAP projection\nprojection = perform_2D_projection(embeddings, \"umap\", {\"umap\": {}})\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides functions for performing 2D projections of embeddings using PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP algorithms.\n\n2. What are the input requirements for the `perform_2D_projection` function?\n- The input must be a 2D array of embeddings, and the projection algorithm must be one of \"pca\", \"tsne\", or \"umap\".\n\n3. Why is there a lock used in the `perform_2D_projection_umap` function?\n- UMAP is not thread safe and can crash the server when called on parallel threads, so a lock is used to ensure that only one thread at a time can call the UMAP function."
