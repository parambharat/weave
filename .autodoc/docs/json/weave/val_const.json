  "summary": "The `weave.const` module provides a way to wrap a Python value and encode it as a `Const` type in the Weave type system. This is achieved by calling the `weave.const()` function and passing in the value to be wrapped. The resulting object is an instance of the `Const` class defined in the module.\n\nThe purpose of this module is to allow for the creation of immutable values in the Weave type system. By wrapping a value in a `Const` object, the value cannot be modified or reassigned. This can be useful in situations where a value should not be changed, such as in configuration settings or constants used throughout a project.\n\nThe `Const` class has a single attribute, `val`, which stores the wrapped value. The `__init__()` method initializes the `val` attribute with the passed-in value.\n\nThe `types.Const.instance_classes` line sets the `Const` class as the instance class for the `ConstType` in the Weave type system. This allows the Weave type system to recognize and handle `Const` objects appropriately.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `weave.const` module:\n\n```\nimport weave.const as const\n\n# Wrap a string value in a Const object\nmy_const = const(\"hello\")\n\n# Attempt to modify the value (will raise an AttributeError)\nmy_const.val = \"world\"\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_const` is a `Const` object wrapping the string value \"hello\". Attempting to modify the value by assigning a new value to the `val` attribute will raise an `AttributeError`, preventing the value from being changed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Const` class?\n- The `Const` class is used to wrap a Python value and encode it as a `ConstType` in the Weave type system.\n\n2. How is the `Const` class integrated into the Weave type system?\n- The `Const` class is assigned to the `instance_classes` attribute of the `types.Const` class.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `const` function?\n- The `const` function is used to mark a value as const so that the Weave type system treats it as a `ConstType`."
