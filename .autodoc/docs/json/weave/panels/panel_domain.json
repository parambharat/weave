  "summary": "This code defines two classes, `PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer` and `PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer`, which inherit from the `Panel` class in the `panel` module. These classes are decorated with the `weave.type` decorator, which is used to specify the type of the class for use in the larger `weave` project.\n\nThe `PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer` class has an `id` attribute set to `\"wb_trace_tree-traceViewer\"`, while the `PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer` class has an `id` attribute set to `\"wb_trace_tree-modelViewer\"`. These IDs are likely used to identify and differentiate between different types of panels within the `weave` project.\n\nThe `weave.type` decorator is used with the `__override_name` argument to specify the type of the class. This is likely used to ensure that the class is properly registered and used within the larger `weave` project.\n\nOverall, this code is defining two classes that are used as panels within the `weave` project. The `weave.type` decorator is used to ensure that these classes are properly registered and used within the larger project. The `id` attributes of these classes are likely used to identify and differentiate between different types of panels within the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom weave import PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer, PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer\n\ntrace_viewer = PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer()\nmodel_viewer = PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer()\n\nprint(trace_viewer.id)  # Output: \"wb_trace_tree-traceViewer\"\nprint(model_viewer.id)  # Output: \"wb_trace_tree-modelViewer\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module being imported at the beginning of the code?\n- The smart developer might ask what functionality the `weave` module provides and how it is used in the code.\n\n2. What is the relationship between the `PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer` and `PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer` classes and the `panel.Panel` class?\n- The smart developer might ask how the `PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer` and `PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer` classes inherit from or relate to the `panel.Panel` class.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `id` attribute in the `PanelWBTraceTreeTraceViewer` and `PanelWBTraceTreeModelViewer` classes?\n- The smart developer might ask how the `id` attribute is used in the code and what purpose it serves."
