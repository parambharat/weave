  "summary": "The code defines two classes, `EachColumnConfig` and `EachColumn`, which are used in the larger `weave` project. \n\n`EachColumnConfig` is a generic class that takes a type parameter `RenderType`. It has three attributes: `layoutMode`, which is a string that specifies the layout mode for the panel; `pbLayoutConfig`, which is an optional `PanelBankSectionConfig` object that specifies the configuration for the panel bank section; and `render`, which is a `RenderType` object that specifies the rendering for the panel. The `render` attribute has a default value of `graph.VoidNode()`, which is a function that returns an empty graph node.\n\n`EachColumn` is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and has an `id` attribute set to `\"EachColumn\"`. It also has an optional `config` attribute of type `EachColumnConfig`. \n\nThese classes can be used in the larger `weave` project to create panels with specific configurations and renderings. For example, a developer could create an instance of `EachColumnConfig` with a custom `render` attribute that specifies a graph node with specific properties, and then pass that instance to an instance of `EachColumn` to create a panel with the desired rendering. \n\nHere is an example of how these classes could be used:\n\n```\n# create an instance of EachColumnConfig with a custom render attribute\ncustom_render = graph.Node(label=\"Custom Node\", color=\"blue\")\nconfig = EachColumnConfig(layoutMode=\"horizontal\", render=custom_render)\n\n# create an instance of EachColumn with the custom config\neach_column = EachColumn(config=config)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `EachColumn` class?\n- The `EachColumn` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and represents a panel that displays a single column of data.\n\n2. What is the `EachColumnConfig` class used for?\n- The `EachColumnConfig` class is a generic class that defines the configuration options for an `EachColumn` panel, including the layout mode, panel bank layout configuration, and the type of data to be rendered.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator used in these classes?\n- The `weave.type()` decorator is used to generate type annotations for the class attributes and methods, which can be used for type checking and documentation purposes."
