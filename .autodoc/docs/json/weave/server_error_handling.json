  "summary": "This code provides utilities for handling errors in the Weave server. It defines a class called `WeaveInternalHttpException`, which is a subclass of `werkzeug.exceptions.HTTPException`. This class can be used to create HTTP exceptions directly from an error code. It replaces the old `errors.WeaveHTTPException`. Importantly, it is a subclass of `werkzeug.exceptions.HTTPException`, which means that Flask will properly handle it and return the correct HTTP response. Currently, it is used by the I/O service when encountering an HTTP error, and `weave_http` when getting a download error. It is also used by the `client_safe_http_exceptions_as_werkzeug` to mask non-client-safe errors with a generic 500 error.\n\nThe code also defines a context manager called `client_safe_http_exceptions_as_werkzeug`. This context manager ensures that any error that occurs within the context is properly transformed into a `werkzeug` exception and that the error is client-safe. This is used by middleware and execute methods on the server.\n\nFinally, the code defines a method called `maybe_extract_code_from_exception`. This method can be used to extract the HTTP code from various library's exceptions. This is needed because there are different libraries under the hood that produce different exception classes.\n\nThe code also defines several helper methods that are used by `maybe_extract_code_from_exception` to extract the HTTP code from different types of exceptions. These helper methods include `_extract_code_from_werkzeug_http_exception`, `_extract_code_from_request_lib_request_exception`, `_extract_code_from_gql_lib_error`, and `_extract_code_from_weave_bad_request_error`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to handle errors in the Weave server and ensure that they are properly transformed into `werkzeug` exceptions. This is important for ensuring that the server returns the correct HTTP response and that errors are handled in a client-safe way.",
