  "summary": "This file implements backward compatibility for existing W&B Media types. It defines several data classes and types for different types of media files, including images, audio, video, and HTML. \n\nThe `LegacyImageArtifactFileRefType` class is a temporary type that should never be used. The `ImageArtifactFileRefType` class defines the properties of an image file, including its format, height, width, and sha256 hash. It also includes optional properties for boxes, masks, and classes. The `ImageArtifactFileRef` class is a Weave class that represents an image file and includes an artifact, path, format, height, width, sha256 hash, and optional boxes, masks, and classes. \n\nSimilar classes are defined for other types of media files, including `AudioArtifactFileRef`, `BokehArtifactFileRef`, `VideoArtifactFileRef`, `Object3DArtifactFileRef`, `MoleculeArtifactFileRef`, and `HtmlArtifactFileRef`. \n\nThe file also includes several Weave operations for working with media files, including `html_file` and `markdown_file` for converting HTML and Markdown objects to file references, and `artifactVersion` and `asset_file` for retrieving the artifact version and file path of a media asset. \n\nOverall, this file provides a framework for working with different types of media files in the larger Weave project, ensuring backward compatibility with existing media types and providing a consistent interface for working with media assets.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the LegacyImageArtifactFileRefType class?\n- The LegacyImageArtifactFileRefType class is a temporary type that should never be used. It is implemented for backward compatibility for existing W&B Media types.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the ImageArtifactFileRef class?\n- The ImageArtifactFileRef class is a Weave class that represents an image artifact file reference. It contains information such as the artifact, path, format, height, width, sha256, boxes, masks, and classes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the html_file function?\n- The html_file function is an operation that converts an in-memory Html object to a W&B media type style FileRef so that the existing frontend code can work with it. It returns an HtmlArtifactFileRef object."
