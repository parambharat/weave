  "summary": "This code file is part of the larger project called \"weave\". The purpose of this code is to define GraphQL operations for the \"entity\" domain type. The code imports various modules from the project, including the \"wb_gql_op_plugin\" module from the \"compile_domain\" package, the \"op\" module from the \"api\" package, and various types and operations from other modules within the \"weave\" package.\n\nThe code is divided into six sections, each of which defines a different type of GraphQL operation. The first section defines \"Tag Getters\", but this section is currently empty. The second section defines \"Root Ops\", which are operations that can be used to query the root entity of the domain. In this case, the \"entity\" operation is defined with a name, type, and input parameters. The lambda function returns a string that includes the value of the \"entityName\" input parameter.\n\nThe third section defines \"Attribute Getters\", which are operations that can be used to query attributes of the entity. In this case, the \"entity-name\" operation is defined as an \"op\" with an input of type \"Entity\" and an output of type \"str\". The function returns the value of the \"name\" attribute of the entity's GraphQL representation.\n\nThe fourth section defines \"Direct Relationship Ops\", which are operations that can be used to query relationships between entities. In this case, the \"entity-org\" operation is defined as a \"gql_direct_edge_op\" with an input of type \"EntityType\" and an output of type \"OrgType\". The operation queries the \"organization\" relationship of the entity.\n\nThe fifth section defines \"Connection Ops\", which are operations that can be used to query collections of related entities. In this case, the \"entity-portfolios\" and \"entity-projects\" operations are defined as \"gql_connection_op\" operations with inputs of type \"EntityType\" and outputs of type \"ArtifactCollectionType\" and \"ProjectType\", respectively. The lambda functions return strings that specify the types of collections to query.\n\nThe sixth and final section defines \"Non Standard Business Logic Ops\", which are custom operations that perform some business logic specific to the project. In this case, the \"entity-link\" operation is defined as an \"op\" with an input of type \"Entity\" and an output of type \"Link\". The function returns a \"Link\" object that includes the name and URL of the entity.\n\nOverall, this code file defines a set of GraphQL operations that can be used to query and manipulate entities in the \"weave\" project. These operations can be used by other parts of the project to build more complex functionality. For example, the \"entity-portfolios\" operation could be used to query a list of portfolios associated with a particular entity, which could then be displayed in a user interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how does this file fit into the overall project?\n- A smart developer might ask this question to understand the context of the code snippet. The `weave` module likely contains code related to some sort of data weaving or integration, but without more information it's unclear how this file fits into the larger project.\n\n2. What are the `gql_prop_op`, `gql_direct_edge_op`, and `gql_connection_op` functions doing?\n- These functions are creating GraphQL operations for various types of relationships between entities. A smart developer might ask this question to better understand the purpose and functionality of these operations.\n\n3. What is the `entity_link` function doing and how is it used?\n- This function appears to be defining a custom GraphQL operation that returns a `Link` object for a given `Entity`. A smart developer might ask this question to understand how this function fits into the larger project and how it might be used by other parts of the codebase."
