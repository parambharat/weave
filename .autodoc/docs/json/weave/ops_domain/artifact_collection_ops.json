  "summary": "This file contains a collection of operations and types related to the `ArtifactCollection` domain object in the Weave project. The `ArtifactCollection` represents a collection of artifacts, which are objects that capture the state of a machine learning model at a particular point in time. \n\nThe file is divided into six sections, each of which contains a set of related operations. \n\nThe first section contains no operations. \n\nThe second section contains two operations related to the root of the `ArtifactCollection` domain object. The `root_all_artifacts` operation returns a list of all `ArtifactCollection` objects in the system, while the `root_all_artifacts_gql_resolver` operation is a helper function that is used to implement the `root_all_artifacts` operation. \n\nThe third section contains operations that retrieve specific attributes of an `ArtifactCollection` object, such as its `id`, `name`, `description`, and `createdAt` timestamp. \n\nThe fourth section contains operations that retrieve related objects that are directly connected to an `ArtifactCollection` object, such as its `defaultArtifactType`, `project`, and `artifactMembership`. \n\nThe fifth section contains operations that retrieve related objects that are connected to an `ArtifactCollection` object via a connection, such as its `artifacts`, `artifactMemberships`, and `aliases`. \n\nThe sixth section contains a set of non-standard business logic operations that are specific to the `ArtifactCollection` domain object. These operations include `is_portfolio`, which checks whether an `ArtifactCollection` is a portfolio, `last_membership`, which retrieves the last membership of an `ArtifactCollection`, and `link` and `raw_tags`, which retrieve information about the `ArtifactCollection`'s link and tags, respectively. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of operations that can be used to retrieve information about `ArtifactCollection` objects in the Weave project. For example, the `root_all_artifacts` operation can be used to retrieve a list of all `ArtifactCollection` objects in the system, while the attribute and relationship operations can be used to retrieve specific information about individual `ArtifactCollection` objects. The non-standard business logic operations provide additional functionality that is specific to the `ArtifactCollection` domain object.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how does this file fit into the overall project?\n- This file is part of the `weave` module, which appears to be a collection of Python code for interacting with some external system. The purpose of the module and how this file fits into it is not clear from the code provided.\n\n2. What is the `wb_gql_op_plugin` function and how is it used in this code?\n- `wb_gql_op_plugin` is a function that takes a string template and returns a function that can be used as a decorator for a Python function. The resulting decorated function will generate a GraphQL query string using the template and the input arguments to the function, and then execute the query against the external system. This function is used to define several of the operations in this file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` and `wb_domain_types` modules, and how are they used in this code?\n- `weave_types` and `wb_domain_types` appear to be modules containing Python classes that define the structure of data returned by the external system. These classes are used as input and output types for the various operations defined in this file."
