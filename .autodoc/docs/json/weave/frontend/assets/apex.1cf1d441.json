  "summary": "The code provided is a configuration file for the Apex language. Apex is a programming language used by Salesforce for developing applications on the Salesforce platform. This configuration file defines the syntax highlighting rules for Apex in the context of the larger project called Weave.\n\nThe configuration file defines a regular expression for identifying words and comments in the Apex language. It also defines the syntax for brackets, auto-closing pairs, and surrounding pairs. These are used to provide a better coding experience by automatically closing brackets and quotes as the user types.\n\nThe file also defines a list of keywords, operators, and symbols used in the Apex language. These are used to provide syntax highlighting and code completion features in the code editor.\n\nThe tokenizer defined in the configuration file is used to parse the Apex code and apply the syntax highlighting rules defined in the file. It defines rules for identifying keywords, types, operators, brackets, symbols, and strings in the code.\n\nOverall, this configuration file is an important part of the Weave project as it provides the syntax highlighting and code completion features for Apex code in the Weave code editor. It ensures that developers have a better coding experience and can write code more efficiently. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { conf, language } from 'weave/apex';\n\n// Use the configuration and language in a code editor\nconst editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('container'), {\n  value: '',\n  language: 'apex',\n  theme: 'vs-dark',\n  automaticLayout: true,\n  ...conf,\n  ...language,\n});\n```",
