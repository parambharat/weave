  "summary": "The code in this file defines a React functional component called `PanelFileMarkdown`. This component takes in props of type `PanelFileMarkdownProps`, which is defined as a type alias for `Panel2.PanelProps<typeof inputType>`. The `inputType` object is imported from a file called `common.ts` in the same directory.\n\nThe purpose of this component is to display the contents of a markdown file in a panel. It does this by first calling the `Op.opFileContents` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library, passing in the file path from the `props.input` object. This function returns a `contentsNode` object, which is then passed to the `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook from the `@wandb/weave/react` library. This hook returns a `contentsValueQuery` object, which contains a `loading` property indicating whether the file contents are still being fetched, and a `result` property containing the actual contents of the file.\n\nIf the `loading` property is true, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, it checks if the `content` property is null, and throws an error if it is. Finally, it renders a `div` with a white background, a border, and padding, containing a `Markdown` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components` library. The `condensed` prop of this component is set to `false`, and the `content` prop is set to the `result` property of the `contentsValueQuery` object.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display the contents of markdown files in a panel. It can be imported and used like any other React component, passing in the appropriate props. For example:\n\n```\nimport PanelFileMarkdown from './PanelFileMarkdown';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PanelFileMarkdown input=\"/path/to/file.md\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a React functional component called `PanelFileMarkdown` that renders a Markdown file within a panel.\n\n2. What dependencies are being imported in this file?\n- This file imports `Markdown` from `@wandb/weave/common/components/Markdown`, `Op` from `@wandb/weave/core`, `React`, `CGReact`, and `Panel2` from `../panel`, and `inputType` from `./common`.\n\n3. What does the `Op.opFileContents` function do?\n- The `Op.opFileContents` function takes an object with a `file` property and returns a Weave node that represents the contents of the specified file."
