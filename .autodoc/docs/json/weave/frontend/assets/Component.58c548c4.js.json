  "summary": "The code in this file defines a React functional component called `PanelPreviewImage`. This component is used to display a preview image of a file in a panel. The component takes in a set of props that define the input type for the panel and passes them to the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel2` module. \n\nThe component first extracts the `fileNode` from the input props and casts it to a `Node` type. It then uses the `opFileDirectUrl` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module to get the direct URL of the file. This URL is then passed to the `LLReact.useNodeValue` hook to get the value of the URL. \n\nThe component then renders an `img` tag with the `src` attribute set to the direct URL of the file. If the `directUrlValue` is still loading, the component displays an empty `div` tag. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a preview image of a file in a panel. For example, if the project has a file upload feature, this component can be used to display a preview of the uploaded file in a panel before it is saved. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport PanelPreviewImage from 'weave/Component';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const fileNode = props.fileNode;\n  return (\n    <PanelPreviewImage input={fileNode} />\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a React functional component called `PanelPreviewImage` that displays an image based on a file input node.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code file have?\n- This code file imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave/core`, `react`, `../../../react`, and `../panel` packages.\n\n3. What is the TODO comment referring to in this code file?\n- The TODO comment refers to a line of code that needs to be fixed by grabbing the incoming file path input node."
