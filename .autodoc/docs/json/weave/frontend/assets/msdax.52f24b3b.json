  "summary": "The code defines a configuration object `E` and a language object `T` for the MSDAX language. MSDAX is a query language used in Microsoft Power BI and Analysis Services to define calculations and queries on data models. \n\nThe `E` object defines the comment syntax, brackets, and auto-closing pairs used in MSDAX. The `T` object defines the keywords, functions, and tokenizer rules for the language. The tokenizer rules define how the language is parsed and tokenized for syntax highlighting and code analysis. \n\nThis code is an important part of the larger Weave project because it provides the language definition for MSDAX, which is used in Weave's query editor. The language definition is used to provide syntax highlighting and code analysis features to the user. \n\nHere is an example of how the language definition can be used in a code editor:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';\nimport { conf, language } from 'weave/msdax';\n\nmonaco.languages.register({ id: 'msdax' });\nmonaco.languages.setMonarchTokensProvider('msdax', language);\nmonaco.languages.setLanguageConfiguration('msdax', conf);\n\nconst editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('editor'), {\n  value: '',\n  language: 'msdax'\n});\n```\n\nThis code registers the MSDAX language with the Monaco editor and sets the language definition and configuration. The editor will now provide syntax highlighting and code analysis for MSDAX code.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines the syntax highlighting rules for the MSDAX language in the Weave project.\n\n2. What are some of the keywords and functions supported by this language?\n- The language supports keywords such as VAR, RETURN, and ORDER, and functions such as SUM, COUNT, and DATEADD.\n\n3. What is the format of the auto-closing pairs defined in this code?\n- The auto-closing pairs are defined as an array of objects, with each object containing an open and close character, and a notIn property specifying where the pair should not be auto-closed (e.g. within a string or comment)."
