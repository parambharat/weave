  "summary": "The code in this file defines a React component called `BokehViewer` that renders a Bokeh plot. The component takes in a `bokehJson` prop, which is a JSON object representing the Bokeh plot to be rendered. The component first checks if the `bokehJson` prop is defined and has a `version` property. If not, it returns an empty fragment. If the `bokehJson` prop is defined and has a `version` property, the component checks if the Bokeh library has been loaded. If not, it loads the library by injecting a script tag into the document and waits for it to load before setting the `libraryLoaded` state to true. Once the library is loaded, the component renders the `BokehViewerInner` component, which is responsible for rendering the actual Bokeh plot.\n\nThe `BokehViewerInner` component creates a div element with a unique ID and a ref to that element. It then uses the `useEffect` hook to render the Bokeh plot when the `bokehJson` prop changes. If the `bokehJson` prop is not defined or the `contentNotFound` prop is true, the component renders any `notFoundElements` passed in as props. Otherwise, it renders the Bokeh plot using the `Bokeh.embed.embed_item` method.\n\nThe `loadBokehLibrary` function is used to load the Bokeh library by injecting a script tag into the document. It takes in a `version` parameter, which defaults to `'2.2.3'`, and a `callback` parameter, which is called once the library has finished loading. The function first checks if the library has already been loaded by looking for an existing script tag with a specific ID. If the library has not been loaded, it creates a new script tag with the appropriate version and appends it to the document body. It then listens for the script's `load` event and calls the `callback` function once the script has finished loading. If the library has already been loaded, the function simply calls the `callback` function.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that involves rendering Bokeh plots in a web application. The `BokehViewer` component can be used to render Bokeh plots by passing in the appropriate `bokehJson` prop. The `loadBokehLibrary` function ensures that the correct version of the Bokeh library is loaded before rendering the plot. Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to render Bokeh plots in a React application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `loadBokehLibrary` function?\n    \n    The `loadBokehLibrary` function injects a bokeh library fetch based on the version of the bokeh content to ensure compatibility between the user's python bokeh version and the JS version.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `BokehViewer` component?\n    \n    The `BokehViewer` component renders a Bokeh plot using the `bokehJson` prop passed to it, after ensuring that the required Bokeh library is loaded.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `PanelBokeh` component?\n    \n    The `PanelBokeh` component is a React functional component that renders a Bokeh plot using the `BokehViewer` component and the `useAssetContentFromArtifact` hook to fetch the Bokeh plot data from an external source."
