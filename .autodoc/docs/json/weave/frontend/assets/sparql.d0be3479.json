  "summary": "The code defines a configuration object `e` and a language object `s` for the SPARQL language. SPARQL is a query language used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format. The configuration object `e` defines the syntax highlighting rules for the language, including comments, brackets, keywords, and functions. The language object `s` defines the tokenization rules for the language, including how to identify and group different types of tokens such as tags, strings, and operators.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide syntax highlighting and tokenization support for SPARQL queries in the larger project. This code can be used by text editors or IDEs to provide syntax highlighting and code completion for SPARQL queries. For example, a developer working on a project that uses RDF data can use this code to write and debug SPARQL queries with ease.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in a text editor:\n\n```javascript\nimport { conf, language } from 'weave/sparql';\n\n// Set up the editor with the SPARQL language configuration and rules\nconst editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('editor'), {\n  value: '',\n  language: 'sparql',\n  automaticLayout: true,\n  ...conf,\n  ...language,\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `conf` and `language` objects from the `weave/sparql` module and use them to configure a Monaco editor instance. The `conf` object is spread into the editor options to set up the syntax highlighting rules, while the `language` object is used to set up the tokenization rules for the SPARQL language. With this setup, the editor can provide syntax highlighting and code completion for SPARQL queries.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n    \n    This code file defines the syntax highlighting rules for the SPARQL language in the Weave project.\n\n2. What are the supported brackets and auto-closing pairs in this language?\n    \n    The supported brackets are curly braces, parentheses, square brackets, and angle brackets. The auto-closing pairs include single and double quotes, curly braces, square brackets, and parentheses.\n\n3. What are some of the keywords and built-in functions supported by this language?\n    \n    Some of the keywords supported by this language include SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT. Some of the built-in functions supported include ABS, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and STRLEN."
