  "summary": "The code in this file defines a React functional component called `PanelHTML` that renders an HTML file within an iframe. The component takes in props of type `PanelProps<typeof inputType>`, which is defined in another file. The `input` property of the props is used to retrieve the URL of the HTML file using the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook, which is also defined in another file. If the URL is still loading, the component returns a `WandbLoader` component, which is imported from the `@wandb/weave/common/components` package. If the URL is null, the component returns a simple `div` element with a dash. Otherwise, the component returns an `iframe` element with the `src` attribute set to the retrieved URL. The `sandbox` attribute is set to allow the iframe to run scripts and access resources from the same origin as the parent document. The `style` attribute sets the border, height, and width of the iframe to 0, 100%, and 100%, respectively.\n\nThis component is likely used in the larger project to display HTML files that are generated as part of the project's output. The `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook is used to retrieve the URL of the HTML file from the project's artifacts, which are likely stored in a database or file system. The `WandbLoader` component is used to display a loading spinner while the URL is being retrieved. The `sandbox` attribute is used to prevent the HTML file from accessing resources outside of the parent document's origin, which is a security measure. Overall, this component provides a simple way to display HTML files within the project's UI. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport PanelHTML from 'weave/Component';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const input = { /* input object */ };\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>HTML File</h1>\n      <PanelHTML input={input} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code defines a React functional component called `PanelHTML` that renders an HTML file in an iframe. It uses the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook to get the URL of the HTML file and displays a loading spinner while the file is being fetched.\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports `WandbLoader` from the `@wandb/weave/common/components` package and `React` from the `react` package. It also imports other components and hooks from within the `weave` project.\n3. What props does the `PanelHTML` component accept?\n   - The `PanelHTML` component accepts props of type `PanelProps<typeof inputType>`, which is defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `input` prop is used to get the URL of the HTML file to be displayed."
