  "summary": "The `weave` module is being imported along with `weave_internal` and `weave_plotly`. The `TIME_SERIES_BIN_SIZES_SEC` variable is a list of time intervals in seconds that are used to bin time series data. The `N_BINS` variable is the number of bins to show in the plot. \n\nThe `mark_py_type` and `mark_weave_type` variables are used to define the type of mark to use in the plot. The `TimeSeriesConfig` class is defined with several attributes that are used to configure the time series plot. The `first_column_of_type` function is used to extract the first column of a given type from a node. The `function_to_string` function is used to convert a function to a string. \n\nThe `TimeSeries` class is defined as a subclass of `weave.Panel`. It has an `input_node` attribute and an optional `config` attribute. The `__init__` method initializes the `config` attribute with default values if it is not provided. The `initialize` method initializes the `config` attribute with values based on the input data. The `render_config` method renders the configuration editor for the time series plot. The `render` method renders the time series plot using the configuration specified in the `config` attribute. \n\nOverall, this code defines a class for creating time series plots with configurable options. It uses the `weave` module to define the plot and `weave_plotly` to render it. The `TimeSeriesConfig` class defines the options for the plot, and the `TimeSeries` class uses these options to render the plot. The `first_column_of_type` and `function_to_string` functions are used to extract data and convert functions to strings, respectively.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TIME_SERIES_BIN_SIZES_SEC` list?\n   \n   The `TIME_SERIES_BIN_SIZES_SEC` list contains a range of time intervals in seconds that are used for binning time series data. The intervals range from nanoseconds to years and are used for smooth zooming in the plot.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `function_to_string` function?\n   \n   The `function_to_string` function takes a function as input and returns a string representation of that function. It is used to display the function in the config editor.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `first_column_of_type` function?\n   \n   The `first_column_of_type` function takes two types as input and returns a tuple of two functions. The first function takes a list of items and returns the first item that matches the desired type. The second function takes an item and returns the first value that matches the desired type. It is used to extract the first column of a table that matches a certain type."
