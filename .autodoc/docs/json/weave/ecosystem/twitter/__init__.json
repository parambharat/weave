  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for creating a weave object, which is used to combine multiple input streams into a single output stream. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to interleave the data from multiple sources in a deterministic way, so that the output stream is always in the same order regardless of the order in which the input streams are received.\n\nThe weave object is created by calling the `Weave` constructor, which takes an array of input streams as its argument. Each input stream is represented by a `Readable` object, which is a built-in Node.js class for reading data from a stream. The `Weave` constructor creates a new `Transform` stream, which is a built-in Node.js class for transforming data as it passes through a stream. The `Transform` stream is used to interleave the data from the input streams and write it to the output stream.\n\nThe `Weave` class has a single method called `addStream`, which can be used to add additional input streams to the weave object after it has been created. This method takes a single argument, which is a `Readable` object representing the new input stream. Once the new input stream has been added, the data from all input streams will be interleaved in the output stream.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Weave` class might be used in a larger project:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Weave } = require('weave');\n\nconst stream1 = createReadStream('file1.txt');\nconst stream2 = createReadStream('file2.txt');\nconst stream3 = createReadStream('file3.txt');\n\nconst weave = new Weave([stream1, stream2]);\n\nweave.addStream(stream3);\n\nweave.pipe(process.stdout);\n```\n\nIn this example, we create three input streams from three different files. We then create a `Weave` object with the first two input streams, and add the third input stream later using the `addStream` method. Finally, we pipe the output of the `Weave` object to the standard output stream. The resulting output will be a deterministic interleaving of the data from all three input streams.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `weave` function?\n   \n   The `weave` function takes in two strings and weaves them together by alternating characters from each string. The resulting string is returned.\n\n2. What happens if the two input strings have different lengths?\n   \n   If the two input strings have different lengths, the `weave` function will continue alternating characters until it reaches the end of the longer string. The remaining characters from the longer string will be appended to the end of the resulting string.\n\n3. Are there any limitations on the types of characters that can be passed into the `weave` function?\n   \n   No, there are no limitations on the types of characters that can be passed into the `weave` function. It will work with any valid string input, including special characters and whitespace."
