The `weave` project is a JavaScript library that provides a set of tools for building interactive data visualizations. The code in this file is responsible for rendering a context menu that appears when a user right-clicks on a data node in the visualization. The context menu provides a list of actions that can be performed on the node, such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.

The `ActionsTrigger` component is the entry point for the context menu. It takes an input node and an optional list of extra actions as props. When the user right-clicks on the node, the `toggleActions` function is called, which sets the position of the context menu to the cursor position and toggles the visibility of the `ActionsContent` component.

The `ActionsContent` component is responsible for rendering the context menu. It takes an anchor element, a list of actions, an input node, a stack, and a close function as props. The `anchor` prop is used to position the context menu relative to the cursor position. The `actions` prop is a list of `NodeAction` objects that define the actions that can be performed on the node. The `input` prop is the data node that was right-clicked on. The `stack` prop is a stack of data nodes that represent the current state of the visualization. The `close` function is called when the user clicks outside the context menu to close it.

The `ActionsContent` component uses the `useWeaveContext` hook to get access to the `weave` object, which provides a set of utility functions for working with data nodes. It uses the `useEffect` hook to asynchronously resolve the labels and descriptions for each action in the `actions` prop. It then renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Menu` component that contains a list of `Menu.Item` components, each of which represents an action that can be performed on the node. The `Menu.Item` components are rendered using the `map` function to iterate over the `items` state variable, which is an array of objects that contain the label, description, and action for each item.

The `ActionsContent` component also renders an expression and a type for the input node. The expression is a string representation of the node's value, and the type is a string representation of the node's data type. The `detailed` state variable is used to toggle between a detailed and a summary view of the expression and type. The `MiniExpression` component is a styled component that renders the expression and type strings.

The `ActionsContent` component uses the `ReactDOM.createPortal` function to render the context menu outside of the component's parent DOM hierarchy. This is necessary because the context menu needs to be positioned relative to the cursor position, which is not possible if the menu is rendered inside the parent hierarchy.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and extensible context menu that can be used to perform a wide range of actions on data nodes in the `weave` visualization. The `ActionsTrigger` component can be used in conjunction with other `weave` components to build complex interactive visualizations that allow users to explore and analyze data in real time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?
- The code is part of the `weave` project, but it is not clear what the project does or what its goals are.

2. What is the purpose of the `ActionsTrigger` component and how is it used?
- The `ActionsTrigger` component is used to display a context menu of available actions when a user clicks on a specific element. It takes an `input` prop which is used to determine which actions are available, and an optional `extraActions` prop to add additional actions.

3. What is the purpose of the `ActionsContent` component and how is it used?
- The `ActionsContent` component is used to render the context menu that appears when the `ActionsTrigger` is clicked. It takes several props including `actions` which is an array of available actions, `input` which is the node that the actions will be performed on, and `stack` which is the stack of nodes that the `input` node is a part of.
