The code in this file defines interfaces and types related to actions that can be performed on nodes in the Weave project. Weave is a project that likely involves some sort of graph or tree structure, where nodes represent some sort of data or object and actions can be performed on those nodes.

The `NodeAction` interface defines the properties of an action that can be performed on a node. These properties include the name of the action (which is displayed in bold in the actions menu), an optional detail string, an icon, a function that determines whether the action is available for a given node, and a function that performs the action. There are also optional functions for handling hover events on the node.

The `WeaveActionsContextState` interface defines the state of the actions context, which includes an array of `NodeAction` objects. The `withNewActions` method returns a new `WeaveActionsContextState` object with the given actions added to the existing array.

The `WeaveActionsContextProviderProps` type is used to define the props for a React component that provides the actions context. The `newActions` prop is an array of `NodeAction` objects that will be added to the actions context.

Overall, this code provides a way to define and manage actions that can be performed on nodes in the Weave project. These actions can be customized and added to the actions menu for each node, allowing for a flexible and extensible system for interacting with the data represented by the nodes. Here is an example of how this code might be used:

```typescript
import { WeaveActionsContextState, NodeAction } from 'weave';

// Define a custom action
const customAction: NodeAction = {
  name: 'Custom Action',
  isAvailable: (node) => node.type === 'custom',
  doAction: (node) => console.log('Performing custom action on node:', node),
};

// Create a new actions context state with the custom action added
const newActions: NodeAction[] = [customAction];
const actionsContextState: WeaveActionsContextState = {
  actions: [],
  withNewActions: (actions) => ({ actions }),
}.withNewActions(newActions);

// Render a component that uses the actions context
<MyWeaveComponent actionsContextState={actionsContextState} />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NodeAction` interface?
   - The `NodeAction` interface defines the structure of an action that can be performed on a `Node` object, including its name, detail, icon, availability, and function to perform the action.
2. What is the `WeaveActionsContextState` interface used for?
   - The `WeaveActionsContextState` interface defines the state of the actions available in the Weave context, including an array of `NodeAction` objects and a method to update the actions with new ones.
3. How is the `WeaveActionsContextProviderProps` type used?
   - The `WeaveActionsContextProviderProps` type is used as a prop for a React component that provides a new set of `NodeAction` objects to the Weave context.
