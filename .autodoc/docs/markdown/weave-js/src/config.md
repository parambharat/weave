This code defines an interface called `Config` which specifies a set of methods and properties that can be used to configure the behavior of the `weave` project. The `Config` interface includes a boolean property called `ENABLE_DEBUG_FEATURES` and three methods: `urlPrefixed`, `backendWeaveExecutionUrl`, and `backendWeaveViewerUrl`. 

The `urlPrefixed` method takes a string argument and returns a string with a URL prefix. The `backendWeaveExecutionUrl` method takes an optional boolean argument and returns a string with a URL for executing a Weave backend. If the `shadow` argument is true, the URL will include a `/shadow_execute` path, otherwise it will include a `/execute` path. The `backendWeaveViewerUrl` method returns a string with a URL for viewing a Weave backend. The `backendWeaveOpsUrl` method returns a string with a URL for performing operations on a Weave backend.

The code also defines a constant called `WEAVE_BACKEND_HOST` which is set to the value of `window.CONFIG.WEAVE_BACKEND_HOST` if it exists, otherwise it is set to an empty string.

The code then defines a default configuration object called `DEFAULT_CONFIG` which includes the `urlPrefixed`, `backendWeaveExecutionUrl`, `backendWeaveOpsUrl`, and `backendWeaveViewerUrl` methods, as well as the `ENABLE_DEBUG_FEATURES` property. The `urlPrefixed` method is set to a function that simply returns the input string. The `backendWeaveExecutionUrl`, `backendWeaveOpsUrl`, and `backendWeaveViewerUrl` methods are set to the corresponding functions defined earlier in the code. The `ENABLE_DEBUG_FEATURES` property is set to `false`.

Finally, the code exports a function called `getConfig` which returns the current configuration object. The code also exports a function called `setConfig` which takes a partial configuration object as an argument and merges it with the current configuration object.

This code allows the `weave` project to be configured with various options, such as enabling debug features or specifying URLs for backend execution and viewing. The `getConfig` function can be used to retrieve the current configuration object, while the `setConfig` function can be used to update the configuration object with new values. For example:

```
import getConfig, { setConfig } from 'weave';

// Get the current configuration object
const config = getConfig();

// Update the configuration object with new values
setConfig({
  ENABLE_DEBUG_FEATURES: true,
  backendWeaveExecutionUrl: (shadow: boolean = false) => {
    if (shadow) {
      return 'https://example.com/shadow_execute';
    }
    return 'https://example.com/execute';
  },
});

// Get the updated configuration object
const updatedConfig = getConfig();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Config` interface?
   - The `Config` interface defines the shape of an object that contains various URLs and a boolean flag for enabling debug features.
2. What is the significance of the `WEAVE_BACKEND_HOST` constant?
   - The `WEAVE_BACKEND_HOST` constant is used to retrieve the backend host URL from the global `CONFIG` object, falling back to an empty string if it is not defined.
3. How can the `config` object be modified?
   - The `setConfig` function can be used to merge a partial `Config` object into the existing `config` object, allowing for modification of the various URLs and debug flag.
