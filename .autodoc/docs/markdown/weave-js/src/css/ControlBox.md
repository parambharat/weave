The code above is a LESS stylesheet that defines the styling for a control box popup and a control box picker in the Weave project. 

The `.ui.popup.control-box-popup` class defines the styling for the control box popup. It contains a nested `.ui.buttons` class that sets the margin to 0 pixels. This ensures that the buttons within the popup are aligned properly. 

The `.control-box-picker` class defines the styling for the control box picker. It sets the cursor to a pointer, indicating that it is clickable, and sets the color to a gray shade defined by the `@gray700` variable. 

This code is important for the Weave project as it ensures that the control box popup and picker are styled consistently across the application. Developers can use these classes in their HTML code to ensure that the styling is applied correctly. 

For example, to use the control box picker, a developer could add the following HTML code:

```
<div class="control-box-picker">
  <span>Click me!</span>
</div>
```

This would create a clickable element with the text "Click me!" that is styled according to the `.control-box-picker` class. 

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the Weave project's user interface, ensuring that the control box popup and picker are styled consistently and effectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@import` statement at the beginning of the code?
   - The `@import` statement is importing a file called `globals.less` from the `common/css` directory of the `@wandb/weave` library, which contains common CSS styles used throughout the project.

2. What is the purpose of the `.ui.popup.control-box-popup` selector?
   - The `.ui.popup.control-box-popup` selector is targeting a specific UI element in the project, likely a popup box related to a control box feature.

3. What is the significance of the `@gray700` variable used in the `.control-box-picker` selector?
   - The `@gray700` variable is likely a reference to a specific shade of gray defined in the `globals.less` file, and is being used to set the color of the text in the `.control-box-picker` element.
