The code above is a styled component that creates a fixed position div element with a white background, padding of 8 pixels, and a border of 1 pixel solid color. The position of the div is determined by the x and y coordinates passed in as props. The div is positioned to the right and top of the screen based on these coordinates. The border color is set using a constant value from the `@wandb/weave/common/util/colors` module.

This component can be used in a larger project to create a fixed position element that can be displayed on top of other elements on the screen. The `Wrapper` component can be imported and used in other components to create a consistent UI design across the project. The `position` prop can be passed in dynamically to position the element in different locations on the screen.

Example usage:

```
import { Wrapper } from 'weave';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Wrapper position={{ x: 100, y: 50 }}>
      <p>This is a fixed position element</p>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};
```

In the example above, the `Wrapper` component is used to create a fixed position element with the text "This is a fixed position element" displayed inside. The `position` prop is passed in with x and y coordinates of 100 and 50 respectively, which will position the element 100 pixels from the right and 50 pixels from the top of the screen.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `GLOBAL_COLORS` import from `@wandb/weave/common/util/colors`?
   - The `GLOBAL_COLORS` import is used to set the color of the border in the `Wrapper` component.

2. What is the significance of the `position` prop in the `Wrapper` component?
   - The `position` prop is used to set the position of the `Wrapper` component on the screen, with the `x` and `y` values determining the right and top positions respectively.

3. Why is the `z-index` property set to `20001` in the `Wrapper` component?
   - The `z-index` property is set to `20001` to ensure that the `Wrapper` component is displayed above other elements on the page, as it is a fixed position element.
