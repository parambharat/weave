The code above defines a styled tooltip component using the `styled-components` library and the `Popup` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library. The purpose of this component is to provide a customizable tooltip that can be used throughout the larger project.

The `Tooltip` component is defined as a styled version of the `Popup` component, with some additional attributes and styles. The `basic` attribute is set to `true`, which removes the pointing arrow from the tooltip. The `mouseEnterDelay` attribute is set to `500`, which adds a delay before the tooltip appears when the user hovers over the element. The `popperModifiers` attribute is an object that contains a `preventOverflow` property, which prevents the tooltip from being positioned outside of the viewport.

The `Tooltip` component also has some custom styles defined using the `&&` syntax, which allows for more specific targeting of the component's styles. The `color` property sets the text color to white, the `background` property sets the background color to a dark gray, the `border-color` property sets the border color to a slightly lighter gray, and the `box-shadow` property adds a subtle shadow effect to the tooltip. The `font-size` and `line-height` properties set the text size and spacing, and the `max-width` property limits the width of the tooltip to 300 pixels.

This `Tooltip` component can be used throughout the larger project by importing it and using it as a component in other parts of the code. For example, if there is a button that needs a tooltip, the `Tooltip` component can be wrapped around the button component to provide the tooltip functionality. 

Example usage:

```
import React from 'react';
import {Button} from 'semantic-ui-react';
import {Tooltip} from './path/to/Tooltip';

const MyButton = () => {
  return (
    <Tooltip content='Click me for more information'>
      <Button>Learn More</Button>
    </Tooltip>
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code is a styled component for a tooltip using the `semantic-ui-react` library and `globals.styles` from the `common/css` directory. A smart developer might want to know how this tooltip component is used within the `weave` project and what other components it interacts with.

2. What is the significance of the `basic` and `popperModifiers` properties in the `Tooltip` component?
- The `basic` property removes the pointing arrow from the tooltip, while the `popperModifiers` property prevents the tooltip from being constrained by the popper and causing it to close immediately. A smart developer might want to know how these properties affect the behavior and appearance of the tooltip.

3. How is the `Tooltip` component styled and what are its default values?
- The `Tooltip` component is styled using CSS properties such as `color`, `background`, `border-color`, `box-shadow`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `max-width`. Its default values are set to specific colors and dimensions using variables from the `globals.styles` file. A smart developer might want to know how to customize these values for different use cases.
