This code defines a styled component called `IconButton` that can be used to create clickable icons with customizable size. The component is created using the `styled-components` library and takes an optional boolean prop called `small` that determines whether the icon should be small or not. 

The component's styles include setting the cursor to pointer, centering the icon both horizontally and vertically, and applying a gray color to the icon. When the user hovers over the icon, the color changes to a darker gray and the background color changes to a lighter gray. Additionally, if the icon is not the last child of its parent element, it will have a margin-right of 4px.

This component can be used in various parts of the larger project to create clickable icons with consistent styling. For example, it could be used in a toolbar to provide users with a set of actions they can perform on a particular page or component. 

Here is an example of how the `IconButton` component could be used in a React component:

```
import React from 'react';
import { IconButton } from 'weave';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <IconButton>
        <svg>...</svg>
      </IconButton>
      <IconButton small>
        <svg>...</svg>
      </IconButton>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `IconButton` component is used twice, once with the default size and once with the `small` prop set to `true`. The `svg` element inside each `IconButton` represents the icon that will be displayed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `IconButton` component?
- The `IconButton` component is a styled div that can optionally be made small, and contains an SVG icon and hover effects.

2. What is the `globals` import used for?
- The `globals` import is used to access predefined CSS variables for colors, such as `GRAY_500` and `GRAY_600`.

3. What is the purpose of the `not(:last-child)` selector?
- The `not(:last-child)` selector adds a margin to all `IconButton` components except for the last one, which prevents unnecessary spacing after the last button.
