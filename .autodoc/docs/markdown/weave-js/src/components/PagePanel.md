The `PagePanel` component in this code is responsible for rendering the main content area of the Weave project. It handles the loading and display of different types of panels, such as individual panels or panel groups, and provides additional controls for Jupyter Notebook users.

The `PagePanel` component uses the `WeaveRoot` and `PageContentContainer` styled components to create the main layout. It also uses the `ThemeProvider` to apply a light theme to the content. The `PanelRenderedConfigContextProvider` and `PanelInteractContextProvider` are used to manage the state of the rendered panel configuration and user interactions with the panel.

The `PageContent` component is responsible for rendering the actual content of the panel. It uses the `ChildPanel` component to display the panel content and the `Inspector` component to display the panel configuration editor. It also provides Jupyter-specific controls, such as "Add new panel", "Edit configuration", "Copy code", "Open in new tab", and "Go home", through the `JupyterPageControls` component.

The `JupyterPageControls` component is a set of controls that are only visible when the Weave project is being used within a Jupyter Notebook. These controls allow users to interact with the panel in various ways, such as adding a new panel, editing the panel configuration, copying the panel code, opening the panel in a new tab, and returning to the home screen.

Overall, this code is responsible for managing the main content area of the Weave project, handling user interactions, and providing additional functionality for Jupyter Notebook users.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `JupyterControls` components in the code?
   **Answer**: The `JupyterControls` components are used to display a set of controls specifically for Jupyter Notebook environments. These controls include options to add a new panel, edit configuration, copy code, open in a new tab, and go home.

2. **Question**: How does the code handle authentication and redirection for users who are not logged in?
   **Answer**: The code checks if the user is authenticated and if the content is served locally. If the user is not authenticated and the content is not served locally, it constructs a new URL for the login page and redirects the user to that URL.

3. **Question**: How does the `PageContent` component handle updating the input node and configuration of the child panel?
   **Answer**: The `PageContent` component uses the `updateConfig` and `updateConfig2` callback functions passed as props to update the input node and configuration of the child panel. It also uses the `useUpdateConfigForPanelNode` hook to handle updates for the panel node.
