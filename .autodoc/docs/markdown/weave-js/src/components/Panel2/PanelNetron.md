The `weave` project is a JavaScript library that provides a set of reusable components and utilities for building machine learning applications. The code in this file is responsible for rendering a Netron preview of a machine learning model. Netron is a viewer for neural network models that allows users to visualize and explore the structure of the model graph.

The `PanelNetron` component is a React functional component that takes an input file node as a prop and renders an iframe that displays the Netron preview of the model. The component first extracts the file type and extension from the input file node. It then uses the `useSignedUrlWithExpiration` hook to generate a signed URL for the file that expires after 60 seconds. The signed URL is used to fetch the file content and create a blob URL that is passed to the Netron viewer. The component also handles loading states and error states.

The `Spec` object exports a `PanelNetron` component that can be used as a panel in the larger project. The `PanelNetron` component takes an input file node and renders a Netron preview of the model. The `Spec` object also exports an `inputType` object that defines the expected input type for the `PanelNetron` component. The `inputType` object is a union of file types that are supported by the Netron viewer.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { Spec } from 'weave/netron';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const fileNode = { type: 'file', extension: 'pt', url: 'https://example.com/model.pt' };
  return (
    <Spec.Component input={fileNode} />
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useDirectUrlToBlobUrl` hook?
   - The `useDirectUrlToBlobUrl` hook is used to fetch and convert a direct URL to a blob URL, which is then used to display a Netron preview of a model file.
2. What is the `PanelNetron` component responsible for?
   - The `PanelNetron` component is responsible for rendering a Netron preview of a model file, given a file node as input.
3. What is the `Spec` object used for?
   - The `Spec` object is used to define the specifications of a panel, including its ID, component, and input type. In this case, it defines the specifications for a Netron panel.
