The `PanelObjectOverview` component is a React functional component that renders a `PanelFacet` component. The purpose of this component is to provide an overview of an object's properties and their types. 

The component takes in a single prop, `input`, which is an object with a `type` property and a `propertyTypes` object. The `opObjectKeyTypes` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library is used to extract the keys and types of the `propertyTypes` object. 

The `TableState.getExampleRow` function is then called with the extracted key types to generate an example row for the table. The `defaultFacet` function is called to create a default configuration for the `PanelFacet`. The `TableState.updateColumnSelect` function is used to update the `table` property of the `facet` object with the type of the example row and the count of the rows. Finally, the `padding` property of the `facet` object is set to 4. 

The `PanelFacet` component is then rendered with the `keyTypes` prop passed in as `input`, the `context` and `updateContext` props passed in from the parent component, and the `facet` object passed in as `config`. The `updateConfig` prop is set to a function that logs "HELLO" to the console. 

The `Spec` object exports a `PanelObjectOverview` component and a `PanelSpec` object. The `PanelSpec` object is used to register the `PanelObjectOverview` component with the `PanelRegistry` in the larger project. 

Example usage:
```jsx
import { PanelObjectOverview, Spec } from 'weave';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const input = {
    type: 'myType',
    propertyTypes: {
      prop1: 'string',
      prop2: 'number',
      prop3: 'boolean',
    }
  };

  return (
    <PanelObjectOverview input={input} context={{}} updateContext={() => {}} />
  );
};

// Register the PanelObjectOverview component with the PanelRegistry
Spec.register();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelObjectOverview` component?
- The `PanelObjectOverview` component is a React functional component that takes in `PanelObjectOverviewProps` and returns a `PanelFacet` component with a specific configuration.

2. What is the `keyTypes` variable and how is it used?
- The `keyTypes` variable is an object that contains information about the types of keys in the `props.input` object. It is used to generate an example row and update the `facet` configuration.

3. What is the purpose of the `updateConfig` prop passed to `PanelFacet`?
- The `updateConfig` prop is not used in the code and is only included as a placeholder function. It can be removed without affecting the functionality of the component.
