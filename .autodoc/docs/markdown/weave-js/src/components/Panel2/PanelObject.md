The `weave` project is a collection of React components for building UIs that display and manipulate data structures. This file contains the implementation of a component called `PanelObject`, which is used to display and edit objects in a key-value table format. 

The `PanelObject` component takes in an `input` object and a `config` object as props. The `input` object is an object with keys and values of various types, and the `config` object is an optional object that contains configuration options for the component. The `PanelObject` component renders a table with rows for each key-value pair in the `input` object. The keys are displayed in the left column, and the values are displayed in the right column. 

The `PanelObject` component uses several other components from the `weave` project to render the values of the object. If the value is a string, number, or date, it is displayed using the `PanelString`, `PanelNumber`, or `PanelDate` components, respectively. If the value is another object, the `PanelObject` component is recursively called to render the nested object. 

The `config` object can contain a `propLimit` property, which limits the number of key-value pairs that are displayed in the table. If the number of key-value pairs in the `input` object exceeds the `propLimit`, only the first `propLimit` pairs are displayed. The `config` object can also contain an `expanded` property, which determines whether the table is initially expanded or collapsed. 

The `PanelObject` component also contains a `PanelObjectConfig` component, which is used to configure the `PanelObject` component. The `PanelObjectConfig` component contains a dropdown menu that allows the user to set the `propLimit` property. 

Overall, the `PanelObject` component is a useful component for displaying and editing objects in a key-value table format. It can be used in conjunction with other components from the `weave` project to build complex UIs for displaying and manipulating data structures. 

Example usage:

```
import {PanelObject} from 'weave';

const myObject = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'Anytown',
    state: 'CA',
    zip: '12345'
  }
};

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <PanelObject input={myObject} />
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?
- The `weave` project is being imported at the beginning of the file, but it is unclear what it does or what the project is for. A smart developer might want to know more about the project's purpose and how this file fits into it.

2. What is the `PanelObject` component used for and how is it rendered?
- The `PanelObject` component is defined in the code, but it is unclear what it is used for and how it is rendered. A smart developer might want to know more about its purpose and how it is used in the project.

3. What is the `Spec` object and how is it used in the project?
- The `Spec` object is defined at the end of the file, but it is unclear what it is used for and how it is used in the project. A smart developer might want to know more about its purpose and how it is used in the project.
