The `ComputeGraphViz` component is responsible for rendering a visualization of a computation graph using the Cytoscape library. The computation graph is represented by an `EditingNode` object, which is normalized using the `graphNorm` function from the `core` module of the `weave` project. The normalized graph is then converted to a format that can be consumed by Cytoscape using the `normGraphToCyto` function from the `graphCyto` module.

The resulting Cytoscape graph is then rendered using the `CytoscapeComponent` from the `react-cytoscapejs` library. The `maxZoom`, `elements`, `style`, and `layout` props are set to control the appearance and behavior of the graph. The `stylesheet` prop defines the visual style of the nodes and edges in the graph using CSS-like selectors and properties.

The `ComputeGraphViz` component is designed to be used within the larger `weave` project to provide a visual representation of computation graphs. It takes in a `node` prop that represents the computation graph to be visualized, as well as optional `highlightNodeOrOp`, `width`, and `height` props. The `useWeaveContext` hook is used to access the `weave` object, which contains the `opStore` used by the `normGraphToCyto` function.

It is important to note that the `ComputeGraphViz` component performs expensive operations on every render cycle, so it is not recommended for use in production as is. The `renderCount` variable is used as a key to force Cytoscape to rerender the graph when necessary.

Example usage:

```
import {ComputeGraphViz} from 'weave/components/ComputeGraphViz';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const node = ... // create an EditingNode object
  return (
    <ComputeGraphViz
      node={node}
      highlightNodeOrOp={...} // optional
      width={...} // optional
      height={...} // optional
    />
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` import and how is it used in the code?
- The `weave` import is used to access the `opStore` property in order to normalize the graph and create a Cytoscape graph visualization.

2. Why is the `renderCount` variable used as a key for the `CytoscapeComponent`?
- The `renderCount` variable is used as a key to force the `CytoscapeComponent` to rerender when the graph changes.

3. Why is there a warning not to use this component in production as is?
- There is a warning not to use this component in production as is because it performs expensive operations on every render cycle, which could negatively impact performance.
