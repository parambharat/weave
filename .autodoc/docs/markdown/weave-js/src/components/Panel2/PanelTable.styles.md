This code defines a set of styled components that are used to create a table view in the larger project. The table view consists of columns, each of which has a header and a body. The header contains the name of the column and various controls, while the body contains the data for that column.

The `ColumnHeader` component defines the styling for the header of each column. It is a `div` element that is styled using `styled-components`. It has a fixed height and width of 100%, and contains a trigger for column actions that is initially hidden. When the user hovers over the header, the column controls are displayed and the column actions trigger becomes visible. The `ColumnName` component defines the styling for the name of each column. It is a `div` element that is styled using `styled-components`. It has a flexible width and is centered within the header. The `IndexColumnVal` component defines the styling for the index column, which is a special column that contains row numbers. It is a `div` element that is styled using `styled-components`. It has a flexible width and height, and is centered within the body of the column. The `FilterIcon`, `ColumnAction`, `TableAction`, `EllipsisIcon`, `TableIcon`, `TableActionText`, `ControlIcon`, and `SortIcon` components define the styling for various controls that are displayed in the column header.

The `ColumnEditorSection`, `ColumnEditorSectionLabel`, `ColumnEditorColumnName`, `ColumnEditorFieldLabel`, `AssignmentWrapper`, `PanelNameEditor`, `PanelSettings`, and `CellWrapper` components define the styling for various elements that are used in the larger project to create a table view.

Overall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components that can be used to create a table view in the larger project. By using these components, developers can ensure that the table view is consistent and visually appealing.
