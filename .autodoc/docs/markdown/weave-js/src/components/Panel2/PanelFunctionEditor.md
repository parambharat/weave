The `PanelFunctionEditor` component is a React functional component that provides a UI for editing a Weave function. It is used in the larger project to allow users to edit the code of a Weave function in a user-friendly way. 

The component imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave/core` and `lodash` libraries. It also imports two modules from the `./panel` file and a `PanelContextProvider` component from another file. 

The `PanelFunctionEditor` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object that contains an `input` property and an `expr` property. The `input` property is a `ConstNode` object that represents the Weave function to be edited. The `expr` property is a `ConstNode` object that represents the expression to be displayed in the editor. 

The component first extracts the `valueNode` from the `props.input` object and uses the `useNodeValue` hook to get the current value of the `valueNode`. If the `valueQuery` object is still loading, the component displays a "Loading..." message. Otherwise, it extracts the `value` from the `valueQuery.result` object. If the `value` is not a function literal, the component throws an error. 

The component then extracts the `inputTypes` from the `value.type.inputTypes` object and creates a `paramVars` object using the `_.mapValues` function from the `lodash` library. The `paramVars` object maps each input type to a variable node with the same name. 

The component then returns a `PanelContextProvider` component that wraps a `WeaveExpression` component. The `PanelContextProvider` component provides the `paramVars` object to the `WeaveExpression` component, which uses it to display the input variables of the Weave function. The `WeaveExpression` component also takes a `setExpression` prop, which is a callback function that is called when the expression is updated. The `updateVal` function is a memoized callback function that updates the `valueNode` object with the new expression. 

Finally, the component exports a `Spec` object that contains metadata about the component. The `Spec` object is used by other components to render the `PanelFunctionEditor` component. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import {PanelFunctionEditor} from 'weave';

const myFunction = constFunction({x: 'number'}, () => voidNode() as any);

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <PanelFunctionEditor
      input={myFunction}
      expr={myFunction.val}
    />
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelFunctionEditor` component?
- The `PanelFunctionEditor` component is used to edit a Weave function with an expression editor.

2. What is the `inputType` object used for?
- The `inputType` object is used to define the expected input and output types for the `PanelFunctionEditor` component.

3. What is the purpose of the `updateVal` function?
- The `updateVal` function is used to update the value of the Weave function being edited by the `PanelFunctionEditor` component. It wraps the new value in a `Const` node to maintain the function format.
