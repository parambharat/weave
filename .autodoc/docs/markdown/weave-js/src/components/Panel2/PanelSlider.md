The `weave` project contains a file that exports three components: `PanelSliderConfig2`, `PanelSlider`, and `Spec`. 

`PanelSliderConfig2` is a React functional component that renders a configuration panel for a slider input. It takes in a `PanelSliderProps` object as a prop, which contains a `config` object with `min`, `max`, and `step` properties. If `config` is not provided, default values are used. The component renders three `WeaveExpression` components, each with a label and an input field. The `WeaveExpression` component is a custom input field that allows the user to enter an expression that evaluates to a number. When the user enters an expression, the component checks if the expression is assignable to a number. If it is, the expression is updated in the `config` object and passed up to the parent component via the `updateConfig` function.

`PanelSlider` is a React functional component that renders a slider input. It takes in a `PanelSliderProps` object as a prop, which contains an `input` object that represents the value of the slider. The component also uses the `config` object to set the `min`, `max`, and `step` properties of the slider. The current value of the slider is obtained from the `valueQuery` object, which is created using the `useNodeValue` hook. When the user moves the slider, the `updateVal` function is called, which updates the value of the `input` object using the `setVal` function.

`Spec` is an object that contains metadata about the slider component. It has an `id` property that identifies the component, a `ConfigComponent` property that points to the `PanelSliderConfig2` component, a `Component` property that points to the `PanelSlider` component, an `inputType` property that specifies the type of input expected by the component, and a `hidden` property that determines whether the component is visible in the UI.

These components can be used in the larger `weave` project to create custom UI components that allow the user to interact with data in a more intuitive way. For example, a data visualization component might use the slider component to allow the user to adjust the range of values displayed in the visualization. The configuration panel component can be used to allow the user to customize the behavior of the slider component.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelSlider` component?
- The `PanelSlider` component is a React functional component that renders a slider input with configurable minimum, maximum, and step values, and updates a Weave expression node with the selected value.

2. What is the difference between `PanelSlider` and `PanelSliderConfig2`?
- `PanelSlider` is the main component that renders the slider input and updates the Weave expression node, while `PanelSliderConfig2` is a configuration component that renders the minimum, maximum, and step options for the slider input.

3. What is the purpose of the `useConfig` hook?
- The `useConfig` hook is a custom hook that returns a memoized configuration object for the `PanelSliderConfig2` component, with default values for the minimum, maximum, and step options if no configuration is provided.
