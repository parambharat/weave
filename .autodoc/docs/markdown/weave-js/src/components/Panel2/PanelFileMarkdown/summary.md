The `PanelFileMarkdown` component in the `weave-js` project is responsible for rendering markdown files in a panel. It is a React functional component that takes in a single prop, `input`, which is of type `inputType`. This prop is used to get the contents of the markdown file using the `opFileContents` operation from the `Op` module. The contents are then passed to the `Markdown` component to render the markdown content.

The component first checks if the contents are still loading. If the contents are still loading, the component returns an empty `div`. If the contents have finished loading, the component checks if the `content` variable is null. If it is null, the component throws an error. Finally, the component returns a `div` that contains the rendered markdown content.

The `inputType` variable in the `common.ts` file defines the acceptable input types for markdown files in the `weave` project. It is an object with two properties: `type` and `members`. The `type` property is set to `'union'`, and the `members` property is an array of objects that define the acceptable file extensions for markdown files (`'md'` and `'markdown'`).

The `index.ts` file exports a constant object called `Spec`, which defines a panel specification for the `weave` project. The `Spec` object has three properties: `id`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` property identifies the panel as `markdown`, the `Component` property is a lazily loaded React component, and the `inputType` property is imported from the `common` module.

Here's an example of how the `PanelFileMarkdown` component could be used in a larger project:

```javascript
import PanelFileMarkdown from './PanelFileMarkdown';

function App() {
  const markdownFile = 'path/to/markdown/file.md';

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Markdown File</h1>
      <PanelFileMarkdown input={markdownFile} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And here's an example of how the `inputType` variable from the `common.ts` file might be used to ensure that only valid input files are accepted:

```javascript
import { inputType } from 'weave';

function readFile(filePath: string) {
  const fileExtension = filePath.split('.').pop();
  const validExtensions = inputType.members.map(member => member.extension);
  if (validExtensions.includes(fileExtension)) {
    // read in file
  } else {
    throw new Error('Invalid file type');
  }
}
```

In summary, the `PanelFileMarkdown` component is responsible for rendering markdown files in a panel, and the `inputType` variable in the `common.ts` file defines the acceptable input types for markdown files. The `index.ts` file exports a panel specification object that can be used in the larger `weave` project to render panels using the specified panel specs.
