The `LocalDashboardsTable` component is a React functional component that renders a table of local dashboards. It imports several functions and components from the `@wandb/weave` and `semantic-ui-react` libraries. The `LocalDashboardsTable` component receives a `PanelProps` object as a prop, which is used to configure the table. 

The `LocalDashboardsTable` component uses the `useWeaveContext` hook to get the current Weave context. It then uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `dataNode` variable, which is a Weave node that represents the local artifact data. The `getLocalArtifactDataTableState` function is called to get the state of the table, which is also memoized using the `useMemo` hook. The `tableConfig` variable is created using the `useConfigChild` hook from the `Panel2` module. The `rowActions` variable is created using the `useMemo` hook and contains two objects that represent the "Delete" and "Rename" actions for each row in the table. 

The `LocalDashboardsTable` component renders a `RenameDashboardModal` component and a `PanelTable` component. The `RenameDashboardModal` component is a modal that allows the user to rename a dashboard. It receives several props, including the current name of the dashboard, whether the modal is open, a function to close the modal, and a function to rename the dashboard. The `PanelTable` component is a table that displays the local dashboards. It receives several props, including the `dataNode` variable, the `tableConfig` variable, the `rowActions` variable, and several functions to update the context and input.

The `useOnDeleteCallback` hook is used to create a callback function that is called when the user clicks the "Delete" button for a row in the table. The `useOnDeleteCallback` hook uses the `useNodeValueExecutor` and `useMakeMutation` hooks to execute a mutation that deletes the dashboard. The `onRenameCallback` function is used to create a callback function that is called when the user clicks the "Rename" button for a row in the table. The `onRenameCallback` function uses the `useNodeValueExecutor` hook to get the current name of the dashboard and sets the `currentName` state variable. The `onRenameModalCallback` function is used to create a callback function that is called when the user renames a dashboard in the `RenameDashboardModal` component. The `onRenameModalCallback` function uses the `useMakeMutation` hook to execute a mutation that renames the dashboard.

Overall, the `LocalDashboardsTable` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a table of local dashboards. It provides functionality to delete and rename dashboards and can be configured using the `PanelProps` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` variable and where is it defined?
- The `weave` variable is used as a context in the `LocalDashboardsTable` component and is defined using the `useWeaveContext` hook imported from `@wandb/weave/context`.
2. What is the `useOnDeleteCallback` function and how is it used?
- The `useOnDeleteCallback` function returns a callback function that is used as an onClick handler for the "Delete" button in the `rowActions` array. It executes a mutation to delete an artifact based on the `rowNode` parameter passed to it.
3. What is the purpose of the `RenameDashboardModal` component and how is it used?
- The `RenameDashboardModal` component is a modal that allows the user to rename a dashboard. It is used in the `LocalDashboardsTable` component when the "Rename" button in the `rowActions` array is clicked. The current name of the dashboard is passed as a prop and the new name is obtained from the user input.
