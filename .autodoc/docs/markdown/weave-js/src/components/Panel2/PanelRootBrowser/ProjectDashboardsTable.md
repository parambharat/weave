The `weave` module is imported along with other modules such as `react` and `Panel2`. The `makeTableState` function takes in two arguments, `weave` and `projectNode`, and returns a table state object. The `getRowExampleNode` function is called to get an example row node, which is used to create a variable node `rowVar`. The `addNamedColumnToTable` function is called to add a column to the table state object. The column is named "Dashboard Name" and its value is a variable node that concatenates various strings to form a URI. The `artifactsNodeToDisplayNameNode` function takes in a node of artifacts and returns a node of artifact names. The `getDataNode` function takes in a project node and returns a node of artifact names. The `ProjectDashboardsTable` function is a React component that takes in props of type `ProjectDashboardsTableProps`. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `dataNode` and `tableState` variables. It also uses the `Panel2.useConfigChild` function to get the table configuration. Finally, it renders a `PanelTable` component with the `dataNode` and `tableConfig` props.

This code is part of the `weave` project and is used to create a table of dashboard names for a given project. The `makeTableState` function creates a table state object with a column for dashboard names. The `artifactsNodeToDisplayNameNode` function is used to convert a node of artifacts to a node of artifact names. The `getDataNode` function is used to get a node of artifact names for a given project. The `ProjectDashboardsTable` component is used to render a table of dashboard names for a given project. This component is used in other parts of the `weave` project to display dashboard names. For example, it could be used in a dashboard selection menu to allow users to select a dashboard to view.

 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` package and how is it being used in this code?
- The `weave` package is being used to create a table state for a dashboard. It is imported and used to create a `WeaveInterface` object, which is passed as an argument to various functions in the code.

2. What is the purpose of the `PanelTable` component and how is it being used in this code?
- The `PanelTable` component is being used to display a table of data in the dashboard. It is being rendered with various props, including `input`, `config`, `context`, and `update` functions.

3. What is the purpose of the `makeTableState` function and how is it being used in this code?
- The `makeTableState` function is being used to create a table state object that is used to configure the `PanelTable` component. It takes a `WeaveInterface` object and a `projectNode` as arguments, and returns a table state object that includes various columns and configuration options.
