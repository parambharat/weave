The `weave` module is imported and several functions and components are defined. The `useLocalObjectsExist` function returns a boolean indicating whether there are any local objects in the artifact data. The `useUniqueTypeNames` function takes a `Node` object and returns an array of unique type names for the objects in the node. The `applyTypeFilter` function takes a `Node` object and a type name and returns a filtered `Node` object containing only objects of the specified type. The `LocalObjectsTable` component takes a `PanelProps` object and an optional `isRoot` boolean and renders a panel card containing a table of local objects grouped by type.

The `useLocalObjectsExist` function is used to determine whether to render the `LocalObjectsTable` component. If there are no local objects, the component returns an empty fragment. Otherwise, the `useUniqueTypeNames` function is called to get an array of unique type names for the objects in the artifact data. The `applyTypeFilter` function is then used to filter the artifact data by type for each unique type name, and a table is created for each filtered `Node` object using the `getLocalArtifactDataTableState` function. Finally, a `PanelCard` component is rendered for each table, with the type name as the title and the table as the content.

This code is part of a larger project that likely involves displaying and manipulating artifact data. The `weave` module provides functions and components for working with artifact data, and the `LocalObjectsTable` component specifically is used to display local objects grouped by type. This component could be used in a dashboard or other interface for exploring and analyzing artifact data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` package and how is it being used in this code?
- The `weave` package is being imported and used to access various functions and components such as `callOpVeryUnsafe`, `opFilter`, and `PanelCard`. The purpose of the `weave` package is not clear from this code alone.

2. What is the `LocalObjectsTable` component and what props does it expect?
- The `LocalObjectsTable` component is a React functional component that takes in props of type `LocalObjectsTableProps` and an optional boolean prop `isRoot`. The `LocalObjectsTableProps` type is defined in another file and is being imported.

3. What is the purpose of the `useUniqueTypeNames` hook and how is it being used in this code?
- The `useUniqueTypeNames` hook takes in a `Node` object and returns an array of unique type names. It is being used to generate the content for the `LocalObjectsTable` component by filtering the `dataNode` object by type and mapping the resulting objects to a table.
