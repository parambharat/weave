The `weave` project is a data visualization tool that allows users to create interactive dashboards and visualizations. The code in this file provides several utility functions and hooks that can be used to create new panels and manipulate data within the dashboard.

The `useCopiedVariableName` hook takes an expression node, an original variable name, and an optional new variable name as input. It returns a new expression node with the original variable name replaced by the new variable name, as well as a new frame object with the new variable name added. This hook can be used to create a copy of an existing variable with a new name.

The `useNewPanelFromRootQueryCallback` hook creates a new panel from a root query. It takes a panel name, a root query, a boolean indicating whether the panel should use a dashboard layout, and an optional callback function as input. It returns a function that can be used to create a new panel. This hook can be used to create a new panel from scratch.

The `useNewDashFromItems` hook creates a new dashboard from a set of child panels. It takes a panel name, a set of child panel configurations, a set of variables, and an optional callback function as input. It returns a function that can be used to create a new dashboard. This hook can be used to create a new dashboard from a set of child panels.

The `opStringConcat` function concatenates a set of strings or expression nodes into a single string. It takes any number of arguments and returns a new expression node representing the concatenated string.

The `opFilterArtifactsToWeaveObjects` function filters a list of artifacts to include only those that are Weave objects. It takes a list of artifacts and a boolean indicating whether the artifacts should be filtered to include only panels as input. It returns a new expression node representing the filtered list of artifacts.

The `getLocalArtifactDataNode` function retrieves the latest version of all local artifacts that are Weave objects. It takes a boolean indicating whether the artifacts should be filtered to include only panels as input. It returns a new expression node representing the filtered list of artifacts.

The `opObjectsToName` function converts a list of artifacts to a list of artifact names. It takes a list of artifacts as input and returns a new expression node representing the list of artifact names.

The `opObjectNameToURI` function converts an artifact name to a URI. It takes an artifact name as input and returns a new expression node representing the URI.

The `getLocalArtifactDataTableState` function creates a new table state object from a list of artifacts. It takes a list of artifacts, a column name, and a Weave interface as input. It returns a new table state object with the specified column added. This function can be used to create a new table from a list of artifacts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useCopiedVariableName` function?
   - The `useCopiedVariableName` function takes an expression node, an original variable name, and an optional new variable name as input and returns a new expression node and a new frame object. It is used to replace all instances of the original variable name in the expression node with the new variable name and update the frame object accordingly.
2. What is the difference between `useNewPanelFromRootQueryCallback` and `useNewDashFromItems` functions?
   - The `useNewPanelFromRootQueryCallback` function creates a new dashboard panel from a root query and a panel name, while the `useNewDashFromItems` function creates a new dashboard panel from a set of child panel configurations and a panel name. The former is used when the root query is the only input, while the latter is used when the child panel configurations and variables are also provided.
3. What is the purpose of the `getLocalArtifactDataTableState` function?
   - The `getLocalArtifactDataTableState` function takes an input node, a column name, and a WeaveInterface object as input and returns a table state object. It is used to add a new named column to the table state object that contains the URI of the local artifact object corresponding to each row in the input node.
