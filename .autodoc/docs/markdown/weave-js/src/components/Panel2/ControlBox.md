The `weave` project includes a file that exports two React components: `ControlsBox` and `ControlsBoxStyle`. These components are used to render a control box that allows users to select a line style for a media card. 

The `ControlsBox` component takes in two props: `box` and `updateBox`. The `box` prop is an object that represents the state of the control box, including its type and line style. The `updateBox` prop is a function that updates the state of the control box. If the `box` prop has a type other than `'box'`, an error is thrown. Otherwise, the `ControlsBoxStyle` component is rendered with the `box` and `updateBox` props passed down to it.

The `ControlsBoxStyle` component renders a `Popup` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library. The `Popup` component is triggered by a `LegacyWBIcon` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/elements/LegacyWBIcon` module. The `LegacyWBIcon` component displays an icon that represents the currently selected line style. When the user clicks on the icon, the `Popup` component is displayed, showing a list of line style options. 

The list of line style options is defined in the `styleOptions` array. Each option is an object with a `key` property that represents the line style and an `icon` property that represents the icon to display for that line style. The `styleOptions` array is used to render a list of `Button` components, each with an icon representing a line style. When a user clicks on a `Button`, the `updateBox` function is called with the new line style as an argument.

Overall, these components provide a user interface for selecting a line style for a media card. The `ControlsBox` component is used to render the control box, while the `ControlsBoxStyle` component is used to render the line style options. The `Popup` component is used to display the line style options when the user clicks on the `LegacyWBIcon` component.
