The `PanelHistogramConfig` module is a React component that provides a configuration panel for a histogram visualization. The component receives a set of properties, including a `config` object and an `updateConfig` function, which are used to manage the state of the configuration panel. The `usePanelContext` hook is used to retrieve the `dashboardConfigOptions` object, which contains additional configuration options that are shared across all panels in the dashboard.

The configuration panel consists of several sections, each containing a set of configuration options. The first section is labeled "Properties" and contains the `dashboardConfigOptions` object. The second section contains a dropdown menu labeled "Bin mode", which allows the user to select the mode for binning the data. The available options are "auto", "bin-size", and "num-bins". Depending on the selected mode, additional configuration options are displayed in the third section.

If the "bin-size" mode is selected, a dropdown menu labeled "Bin size" is displayed, which allows the user to select the size of the bins. The available options are "Auto" and a set of numeric values. If the "num-bins" mode is selected, a dropdown menu labeled "Number of bins" is displayed, which allows the user to select the number of bins. The available options are "Default" and a set of numeric values.

The fourth and fifth sections contain dropdown menus labeled "Min extent" and "Max extent", respectively, which allow the user to set the minimum and maximum values of the x-axis. The available options are "Auto" and a set of numeric values. The maximum value is set to the maximum value of the data by default.

The `PanelHistogramConfig` component is used in conjunction with other components to create a histogram visualization. The `config` object returned by the configuration panel is used to configure the histogram, and the `updateConfig` function is used to update the configuration panel when the user changes the configuration options.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `PanelHistogramConfig` that renders a configuration panel for a histogram visualization.

2. What is the role of the `usePanelContext` hook?
- The `usePanelContext` hook is used to access the dashboard configuration options that are passed down to the `PanelHistogramConfig` component.

3. What is the purpose of the `innerConfig` variable?
- The `innerConfig` variable is used to conditionally render additional configuration options based on the selected histogram binning mode.
