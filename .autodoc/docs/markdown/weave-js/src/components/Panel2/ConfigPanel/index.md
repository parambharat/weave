This file contains common components and utilities for building configuration panels. It is expected to mature and eventually become a general-purpose Weave graph editor. The file imports various components and styles from other files in the project and exports several components for use in other parts of the project.

The `ConfigSection` component is a container for a group of configuration options. It takes a `label` prop to display a header for the section and renders its children as options. The `ConfigOption` component is a single configuration option that takes a `label` prop to display a label for the option and renders its children as the input field for the option. It also takes an optional `postfixComponent` prop to append a component after the input field, such as a button to add a new option.

The file also exports several components for specific types of configuration options. `ModifiedDropdownConfigField` is a modified version of the `ModifiedDropdown` component that is styled to fit within a configuration panel. `NumberInputConfigField` is a component for numerical input fields. `ExpressionConfigField` is a component for input fields that accept Weave expressions. `TextInputConfigField` is a component for text input fields.

The file also exports several styled components for use in the configuration panels. `ChildConfigContainer` is a container for nested configuration options. `ConfigSectionContainer` is a container for a `ConfigSection`. `ConfigSectionHeader` is a header for a `ConfigSection` that displays the `label` and an expand/collapse button. `ConfigSectionHeaderButton` is the expand/collapse button for a `ConfigSection`. `ConfigSectionOptions` is a container for the options in a `ConfigSection`. `ConfigOptionLabel` is a label for a `ConfigOption`. `ConfigOptionField` is the input field for a `ConfigOption`. `ConfigFieldWrapper` is a wrapper for a configuration input field that adds padding and a background color. `ConfigFieldModifiedDropdown` is a modified version of `ModifiedDropdown` that is styled to fit within a configuration panel. `IconDown` is a styled version of the `IconDownUnstyled` component.

Overall, this file provides a set of reusable components and styles for building configuration panels in the Weave project. Developers can use these components to create custom configuration panels for various parts of the project.
