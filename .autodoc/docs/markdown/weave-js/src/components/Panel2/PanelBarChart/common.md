The `inputType` constant in the `weave` project is an object that defines the expected input type for a function or method. The object has a `type` property that is set to `'union'` and a `members` property that is an array of two objects. 

The first object in the `members` array is a dictionary type with an `objectType` property that is also a union type. The `objectType` property can be either `'none'` or `'number'`. This means that the dictionary can have keys of any type, but the values must be either `null` or a number.

The second object in the `members` array is a list type with a `maxLength` property set to `25`. The `objectType` property is also a union type with the same options as the dictionary type. This means that the list can contain any type of value, but each value must be either `null` or a number, and the list cannot have more than 25 items.

This `inputType` object can be used as a type definition for a function or method that expects input of this shape. For example, a function that takes an object with a dictionary and a list property, where the dictionary values are either `null` or numbers and the list items are either `null` or numbers and there are no more than 25 items in the list, could use this `inputType` object as its input type definition.

Example usage:

```
function myFunction(input: typeof inputType) {
  // function body
}

const myInput = {
  dictionary: {
    key1: null,
    key2: 42,
    key3: null
  },
  list: [null, 1, 2, null]
}

myFunction(myInput); // valid input
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `inputType` constant?
    - The `inputType` constant defines a type for input data that can be either a dictionary or a list, with the values being either `none` or `number`, and the list having a maximum length of 25.

2. Why is the `type` property set to `'union' as const`?
    - The `type` property is set to `'union' as const` to indicate that the `inputType` type is a union type, which means it can be one of several different types.

3. What is the significance of the `objectType` property?
    - The `objectType` property is used to define the type of the values in the dictionary or list. In this case, it is also a union type that can be either `none` or `number`.
