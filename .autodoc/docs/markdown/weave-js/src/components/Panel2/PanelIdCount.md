This code is a part of the larger project called "weave". The purpose of this code is to define a React component called "PanelIdCount" that displays the count of "ids" in a list of inputs. The component takes in a "PanelProps" object that specifies the type of input it expects. The input type is defined as a list of objects that can be either "none" or "id". 

The "PanelIdCount" component uses the "opCount" function from the "@wandb/weave/core" library to count the number of "ids" in the input list. The result of the "opCount" function is then passed to the "CGReact.useNodeValue" hook, which returns an object containing the result of the operation and a "loading" flag that indicates whether the result is still being computed. If the "loading" flag is true, the component displays a "-" symbol. Otherwise, it displays the number of "ids" in the input list.

The "PanelIdCount" component is exported along with a "PanelSpec" object that specifies the ID of the component and its input type. This allows other parts of the "weave" project to use the "PanelIdCount" component by importing it and passing in the appropriate input.

Example usage:

```
import { PanelIdCount } from 'weave';

const inputs = [
  { type: 'none' },
  { type: 'id', id: 1 },
  { type: 'id', id: 2 },
  { type: 'none' },
  { type: 'id', id: 3 },
];

<PanelIdCount input={inputs} />
```

This will display "3 ids" since there are three objects in the input list with a type of "id".
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `opCount` function imported from `@wandb/weave/core`?
- The `opCount` function is used to count the number of elements in an array passed as an argument.

2. What is the `PanelIdCount` component rendering?
- The `PanelIdCount` component is rendering a `div` element that displays the number of ids counted from the input array.

3. What is the `inputType` object used for?
- The `inputType` object is used to define the expected shape of the input data for the `PanelIdCount` component. It specifies that the input should be a list of objects that can be either of type `none` or `id`.
