The `ControlFilter` component is a React functional component that provides a UI for filtering data in the larger project. It receives two props: `filterFunction` and `setFilterFunction`. `filterFunction` is a node that represents the filter function, and `setFilterFunction` is a function that updates the filter function. 

The component imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave/core` and `semantic-ui-react` libraries. It also imports the `WeaveExpression` component and a style module. 

The component renders a `FilterControls` component that contains two child components. The first child component is a `WeaveExpression` component that renders an editor for the filter function. The second child component contains two `Button` components. The first `Button` component applies the filter function if it is valid and updates the `filterFunction` prop. If the filter function is not valid, the `Button` is disabled. If the filter function has not changed, the `Button` is labeled "Close". Otherwise, it is labeled "Apply". The second `Button` component discards any changes made to the filter function. 

The component also checks whether the filter function is valid and whether it has changed. If the filter function is not valid, the "Apply" `Button` is disabled. If the filter function has not changed, the "Apply" `Button` is labeled "Close". Otherwise, it is labeled "Apply". 

The `ControlFilter` component is used in the larger project to provide a UI for filtering data. It allows users to specify a filter function and apply it to the data. The component also provides a way to discard changes made to the filter function and remove the filter function altogether. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import {ControlFilter} from 'weave';

function App() {
  const [filterFunction, setFilterFunction] = useState(voidNode());

  return (
    <div>
      <ControlFilter
        filterFunction={filterFunction}
        setFilterFunction={setFilterFunction}
      />
      {/* Render data */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ControlFilter` component?
- The `ControlFilter` component is used to display and edit a filter function, and allows the user to apply, discard, or remove the filter.

2. What is the `WeaveExpression` component used for?
- The `WeaveExpression` component is used to display and edit the filter function expression.

3. What is the significance of the `isValid` variable?
- The `isValid` variable is used to determine whether the current filter function is executable and has a type that is assignable to `maybe('boolean')`. It is used to enable or disable the "Apply" button.
