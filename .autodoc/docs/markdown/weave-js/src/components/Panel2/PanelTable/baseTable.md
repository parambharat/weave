The code in this file defines custom CSS styles for a component called PanelTable, which is built on top of the `react-base-table` library. The purpose of this file is to override some of the default styling provided by `react-base-table` and provide a more customized look and feel for the PanelTable component.

The code defines several CSS classes and rules that target specific elements within the PanelTable component. For example, the `.BaseTable__header` class is used to style the table header, while the `.BaseTable__row` class is used to style individual rows in the table. The code also defines styles for the column resizer, table footer, and frozen rows.

One notable feature of the code is the use of the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the appearance of certain elements when the user hovers over them. For example, when the user hovers over the table header, the column resizer becomes visible. When the user hovers over a row, the background color changes to a light blue.

To use these custom styles, the code must be imported into the PanelTable component after the `react-base-table` styles have been imported. This is done in the `PanelTable.tsx` file using the following code:

```
import BaseTable, {BaseTableProps} from 'react-base-table';
import 'react-base-table/styles.css';
import './baseTable.css';
```

Overall, this file plays an important role in customizing the appearance of the PanelTable component and ensuring that it fits seamlessly into the larger project.
