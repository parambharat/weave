The `ColumnSelector` component is a React functional component that provides a UI for selecting and displaying columns in a table. It is part of the larger `weave` project and is used to manage the state of the table columns. 

The component imports several modules from the `weave` project, including `LegacyWBIcon`, `dynamicMatchWithMapping`, `Node`, and `useWeaveContext`. It also imports several modules from external libraries, including `React`, `lodash`, and `semantic-ui-react`. 

The `ColumnSelector` component takes three props: `inputNode`, `tableState`, and `update`. `inputNode` is an object that represents the input data for the table. `tableState` is an object that represents the current state of the table, including the order of the columns and the columns themselves. `update` is a function that updates the state of the table. 

The component renders a UI that allows the user to select and display columns in the table. The UI consists of two lists: one for available columns and one for displayed columns. The user can drag and drop columns between the two lists to add or remove them from the table. The UI also includes a search bar that allows the user to search for columns by name. 

The `ColumnSelector` component uses several hooks to manage its state. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the `draggingColumn` and `visibleColumnListEl` variables. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `defaultTable`, `colNameMap`, `allColumnNames`, `searchedColumnsAvailable`, and `searchedColumnsUsed` variables. It uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `resetDraggingState`, `updateConfig`, `dropField`, `onContainerDrop`, `addColumn`, `removeColumn`, `addAll`, `removeAll`, and `getSearchMatches` functions. 

Overall, the `ColumnSelector` component provides a flexible and user-friendly way to manage the state of table columns in the `weave` project.
