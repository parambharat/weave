The `weave` project includes a file that exports a function called `refineTableStateExpressions` and two constants called `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` and `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions`. 

The `refineTableStateExpressions` function takes in a `tableState` object, an `inputNode`, a `stack`, and a `weave` object. It returns a promise that resolves to a new `TableState` object. 

The purpose of this function is to refine all table state expressions when their input variable values change. It does this by creating a `rowsNode` object using the `getRowsNode` function from the `Table` module. It then separates the grouped and ungrouped columns and creates `groupedCellFrame` and `ungroupedCellFrame` objects using the `getCellFrame` function from the `Table` module. It then refines the expressions for the grouped and ungrouped columns using the `refineExpressions` function from the `hooks` module. Finally, it returns a new `TableState` object with the refined column select functions. 

The `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` and `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions` constants are created using the `makePromiseUsable` and `vectorizePromiseFn` functions from the `hooks` module. These constants can be used to create hooks that allow components to use the refined table state expressions. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the `weave` project as it allows for the refinement of table state expressions when input variable values change. This is useful for creating dynamic and responsive data visualizations. 

Example usage:

```
import { useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions } from 'weave';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [tableState, setTableState] = useState(initialTableState);

  const refinedTableState = useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions(
    tableState,
    inputNode,
    stack,
    weave
  );

  // use refinedTableState to render data visualization
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `refineTableStateExpressions` function?
- The `refineTableStateExpressions` function refines all table state expressions when their input variable values change, and returns a new table state.

2. What is the difference between `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` and `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions`?
- `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` is a hook that makes the `refineTableStateExpressions` function usable as a promise, while `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions` is a vectorized version of the same function that can handle multiple table states at once.

3. What is the purpose of the `refineExpressions` and `vectorizePromiseFn` functions?
- The `refineExpressions` function refines a list of expressions using a stack and a WeaveInterface, while `vectorizePromiseFn` is a utility function that vectorizes a promise-returning function so that it can handle multiple inputs at once.
