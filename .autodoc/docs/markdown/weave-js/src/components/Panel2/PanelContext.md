The code in this file defines a React context called `PanelContext` and a provider component called `PanelContextProvider`. The context is used to store information about the current panel being rendered, such as the current frame, stack, and path. The provider component is used to create a new stack frame and add variables to it. 

The `PanelContext` context has a number of properties, including `frame`, `lastFrame`, `stack`, `path`, `selectedPath`, `inPanelMaybe`, and `triggerExpressionEvent`. `frame` and `lastFrame` are objects that represent the current and previous frames, respectively. `stack` is an array of objects that represent the current stack of frames. `path` is an array of strings that represent the current path of the panel being rendered. `selectedPath` is an optional array of strings that represents the currently selected path. `inPanelMaybe` is a boolean that indicates whether the panel is inside a `PanelMaybe` component. `triggerExpressionEvent` is a function that is used to trigger an event on a variable in the stack.

The `PanelContextProvider` component takes a number of props, including `newVars`, `newPath`, `selectedPath`, `inPanelMaybe`, `handleVarEvent`, and `dashboardConfigOptions`. `newVars` is an object that represents the new variables to be added to the stack. `newPath` is a string that represents the new path to be added to the panel. `selectedPath` is an optional array of strings that represents the currently selected path. `inPanelMaybe` is a boolean that indicates whether the panel is inside a `PanelMaybe` component. `handleVarEvent` is a function that is used to handle events that occur on consuming expressions of variables added in this frame. `dashboardConfigOptions` is a React node that represents the dashboard configuration options.

The code also defines a function called `propagateExpressionEvent` that is used to propagate an event to a variable in the stack. The function takes a `target` variable, an `event` object, a `stack` array, a `bubbleBy` string, and a `notifyWhom` string. The `target` variable is the variable to which the event is being propagated. The `event` object is an object that represents the event being propagated. The `stack` array is the current stack of frames. The `bubbleBy` string is used to determine how to propagate the event along the DAG. The `notifyWhom` string is used to determine which handlers to call along the way.

Finally, the code defines a function called `useExpressionHoverHandlers` that is used to create event handlers for hovering over and unhovering from an expression. The function takes a `node` variable, which is the expression being hovered over or unhovered from. The function returns an object with two properties: `onExpressionHover` and `onExpressionUnhover`. These properties are functions that are used to trigger the hover and unhover events, respectively. 

Overall, this code is used to manage the state of the current panel being rendered and to propagate events to variables in the stack. It is likely used in conjunction with other components and functions in the larger `weave` project to create a more complex user interface.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `propagateExpressionEvent` function?
- The `propagateExpressionEvent` function is used to propagate an event (e.g. hover, unhover, mutate) to all the variables in a given target node's expression, calling the appropriate event handlers along the way.

2. What is the `handleVarEvent` function used for?
- The `handleVarEvent` function is used to handle events that occur on consuming expressions of variables added in a given stack frame.

3. What is the purpose of the `useExpressionHoverHandlers` hook?
- The `useExpressionHoverHandlers` hook returns two functions (`onExpressionHover` and `onExpressionUnhover`) that can be used to trigger hover and unhover events on a given node's expression, respectively.
