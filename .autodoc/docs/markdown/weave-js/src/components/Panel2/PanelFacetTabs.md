The `weave` project contains a file that exports a React component called `PanelFacetTabs`. This component is used to create a tabbed interface for displaying data. The component takes in a list of data as input and creates a tab for each item in the list. When a tab is clicked, the corresponding item is displayed in a child panel.

The `PanelFacetTabs` component is composed of several sub-components, including `Tabs`, `ChildPanel`, and `ConfigPanel`. The `Tabs` component is responsible for rendering the tabs and handling user interactions. The `ChildPanel` component is responsible for rendering the child panel that displays the selected item. The `ConfigPanel` component is responsible for rendering the configuration options for the component.

The `PanelFacetTabs` component takes in a configuration object that specifies the properties of the tabs and child panel. The configuration object contains a `tab` property that specifies the expression used to generate the tab labels, and a `panel` property that specifies the configuration for the child panel.

The `PanelFacetTabs` component uses the `opGroupby` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library to group the input data by the tab labels. The resulting groups are used to generate the tab labels and to display the corresponding items in the child panel.

The `PanelFacetTabs` component is used in the larger `weave` project to provide a flexible and customizable way to display data in a tabbed interface. The component can be used to display a wide range of data types, including tables, charts, and images. The component can also be customized to meet the specific needs of different projects by modifying the configuration options. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import { PanelFacetTabs } from 'weave';

const data = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 40 },
];

const config = {
  tab: varNode({ type: 'string' }, 'name'),
  panel: {
    id: 'Table',
    input_node: varNode({ type: 'list', objectType: 'any' }, 'item'),
    config: {
      columns: ['name', 'age'],
    },
    vars: {},
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <PanelFacetTabs input={data} config={config} />
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a React component called `PanelFacetTabs` that renders a tabbed interface for displaying child panels. It also includes a configuration component called `PanelFacetTabsConfigComp` for editing the configuration of the `PanelFacetTabs` component.
2. What are the TODO items in this code and why are they important?
- The TODO items are to make the tabs virtualized so that not all of them have to be rendered at once, get rid of the scrollbar, and make the active index part of the configuration so that it can be controlled externally. These are important because they can improve performance and flexibility of the component.
3. What is the purpose of the `usePanelFacetTabsCommon` hook and what does it return?
- The `usePanelFacetTabsCommon` hook is used to extract common functionality and state from the `PanelFacetTabs` and `PanelFacetTabsConfigComp` components. It returns an object containing the item type, configuration, and various update functions for the component.
