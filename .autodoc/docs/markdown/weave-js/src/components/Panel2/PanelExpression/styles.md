This code defines a set of styled components for use in a larger project called "weave". The components are used to create a user interface for an editor or configuration panel. 

The `Main` component is a container for the entire editor panel. It is a flex container that takes up the full height and width of its parent. 

The `EditorBar` component is a flex container that holds the toolbar for the editor. It is positioned at the top of the panel and does not grow or shrink with the size of its contents. 

The `LockToggleButton` component is a button that toggles the lock state of the editor. It is positioned to the right of the toolbar and changes color on hover. 

The `BarButton` component is a button that is used for toolbar buttons. It has no background or border and changes color on hover. 

The `ConfigButton` component is a button that is used to open the configuration panel. It has no background or border and changes color on hover. 

The `PanelHandler` component is a container for the editor content. It is a flex container that grows and shrinks to fill the available space. It can be configured to rotate using a CSS animation. 

The `PanelHandlerContent` component is a container for the editor content. It is a flex container that grows and shrinks to fill the available space. 

The `PanelHandlerConfig` component is a container for the configuration panel. It is a fixed width container that is positioned to the right of the editor content. 

The `ConfigurationContent` component is a container for the configuration panel content. It is a flex container that grows and shrinks to fill the available space. 

The `ConfigurationContentItems` component is a container for the configuration panel items. It is a flex container that grows and shrinks to fill the available space. 

The `ConfigurationContentItem` component is a container for a single configuration panel item. It takes up the full height and width of its parent. 

The `ConfigurationContentControls` component is a container for the configuration panel controls. It is a fixed height container that is positioned at the bottom of the configuration panel. 

The `SidebarWrapper` component is a container for the configuration panel. It is a fixed position container that is positioned to the right of the editor panel. It has a box shadow and a high z-index to make it appear above the editor panel. 

These components can be used to create a flexible and customizable editor or configuration panel for a larger project. For example, the `Main` component could be used as the root component for an editor panel in a code editor application. The `PanelHandler` component could be used to display the code editor content, while the `PanelHandlerConfig` component could be used to display configuration options. The `LockToggleButton` and `ConfigButton` components could be used as buttons to toggle the lock state of the editor and open the configuration panel, respectively.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- As a code documentation expert, I cannot answer this question based on the given code alone. 

2. What is the purpose of the `globals` import from `@wandb/weave/common/css/globals.styles`?
- It is unclear from the code what the `globals` import is used for. 

3. What is the purpose of the `PanelHandler` component and its `lazySusan` prop?
- The `PanelHandler` component is a styled div that has a `lazySusan` prop which, when true, applies a border radius and a rotation animation to the div. It is unclear from the code what the purpose of this component is and how it is used in the `weave` project.
