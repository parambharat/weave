The `ConfigComponent` module is a React functional component that renders a configuration panel for a Weave visualization. The component receives a large number of props, which are used to control the behavior of the panel and its child components.

The configuration panel is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for configuring a different aspect of the visualization. The first section contains a dropdown menu that allows the user to select the type of panel to be displayed. This section is only visible if the expression and panel are not locked.

The second section contains a list of configurable nodes, each of which is rendered using a `PanelComp2` component. The `PanelComp2` component is responsible for rendering the node and its associated configuration options. The `ConfigComponent` module passes a number of props to the `PanelComp2` component, including the node to be rendered, the panel specification, and the current configuration settings.

The third section is only visible if the current panel is a plot panel and the `weavePlotEnabled` flag is set to `true`. This section contains a button that allows the user to edit the table query associated with the plot.

The fourth section is only visible if the current panel is a plot panel and the `weavePlotEnabled` flag is set to `true`. This section contains a `PanelComp2` component that is responsible for rendering the plot panel and its associated configuration options.

The final section contains two buttons that allow the user to apply or discard any changes made to the configuration panel.

Overall, the `ConfigComponent` module is an important part of the Weave visualization system, as it allows users to configure the appearance and behavior of their visualizations. By providing a flexible and extensible configuration panel, Weave makes it easy for users to create complex and sophisticated visualizations with minimal effort.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code is a React component that is part of the `weave` project. The purpose of the project is not clear from this code alone.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `ConfigComponent` function?
- The `ConfigComponent` function takes in a variety of props related to panel configuration and context, and returns a React component that renders a configuration panel for a specific type of panel. The exact inputs and outputs of the function are described in the function signature.

3. What is the purpose of the `isTablePanelHandler` function?
- The `isTablePanelHandler` function takes in a `PanelStack` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the panel is a "table" panel or a "merge" panel with a child that is a "table" panel. This is used to conditionally render certain elements in the configuration panel.
