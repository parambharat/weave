The `PanelExpression` component is a React functional component that renders a panel expression editor. The component imports several dependencies, including `getConfig` from the `config` module, `React`, `Icon`, `Menu`, and `Popup` from the `semantic-ui-react` library, `Editor` from the `slate` library, and `ThemeProvider` from the `styled-components` library. The component also imports several other modules from the `weave` project, including `WeaveActionContextProvider`, `useWeaveContext`, `useWeaveFeaturesContext`, `focusEditor`, `WeaveExpression`, `Sidebar`, `themes`, `Panel2Loader`, `PanelComp2`, `PanelContextProvider`, `ExpressionEditorActions`, `PanelExpressionProps`, `ConfigComponent`, and `usePanelExpressionState`.

The `PanelExpression` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object containing several properties. The component uses the `usePanelExpressionState` hook to initialize the state of the component. The `usePanelExpressionState` hook takes the `props` object as an argument and returns an object containing several properties, including `calledExpanded`, `configOpen`, `exprAndPanelLocked`, `handler`, `inputPath`, `isLoading`, `newVars`, `refinedExpression`, `renderPanelConfig`, `setConfigOpen`, `updateExp`, `updatePanelInput`, `updateRenderPanelConfig`, and `updateRenderPanelConfig2`.

The `PanelExpression` component renders a `ThemeProvider` component that wraps the entire component. The `ThemeProvider` component sets the theme of the component to `themes.light`. The component then renders a `Main` component that contains the entire panel expression editor. The `Main` component contains an `EditorBar` component that renders the expression editor and a `PanelHandler` component that renders the panel handler. The `EditorBar` component contains a `Menu` component that renders the menu bar of the expression editor. The `PanelHandler` component contains a `PanelHandlerContent` component that renders the content of the panel handler.

The `PanelExpression` component also renders a `SidebarWrapper` component that contains a `Sidebar` component. The `Sidebar` component renders the configuration panel of the expression editor. The `PanelExpression` component conditionally renders the `SidebarWrapper` component based on the value of the `standalone` property of the `props` object.

The `PanelExpression` component uses several hooks, including `React.useCallback`, `React.useMemo`, and `React.useRef`. The component also defines several functions, including `onMount` and `actions`.

Overall, the `PanelExpression` component is a complex component that renders a panel expression editor with a configuration panel. The component is designed to be used as part of the larger `weave` project and provides a powerful tool for editing and configuring panel expressions.
