The code in this file is responsible for rendering Weave panels and handling their configurations. It provides a set of React components and hooks to manage the state and interactions of panels within the larger Weave project.

The main component, `PanelComp2`, serves as a proxy for rendering all Weave panels. It takes care of loading states, configuration modes, and error boundaries. It also provides a context for panel paths and fullscreen states.

The `ControlWrapper` component wraps around the panel content and handles the display of controls such as fullscreen and developer query popups. It also manages the state of hovering and fullscreen modals.

The `DevQueryPopup` component displays a popup with query information, input type, and panel configuration when in development mode. It also provides a button to create a new query based on the current panel.

The `makePanel2Comp` function is a higher-order component that wraps around an internal panel component and processes its configuration. It provides a convenient way to create panel components with external configuration handling.

The `Panel` and `PanelConfigEditor` components are wrappers around `PanelComp2` that simplify the usage of panels by handling panel specifications and configuration modes.

The `TransactionalPanelConfigEditor` component is a higher-order component that wraps around `PanelConfigEditor` and manages pending configurations. It provides an "Apply" button to apply the pending configuration changes to the panel.

Overall, this code is essential for managing the rendering and configuration of panels within the Weave project, ensuring a smooth user experience and proper error handling.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `PanelCompErrorBoundary` class and how does it handle errors?
   **Answer:** `PanelCompErrorBoundary` is a class component that acts as an error boundary for the panel components. It catches errors during rendering and lifecycle methods of its child components and displays a fallback UI with a custom error message or a default message. It also handles specific error types like `CGReact.InvalidGraph` and `CGReact.NullResult` and takes appropriate actions based on the error type.

2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `PanelComp2` component and how does it handle different panel specifications?
   **Answer:** `PanelComp2` is the primary proxy for rendering all Weave Panels. It takes a panel specification and other properties as input and renders the appropriate panel component based on the panel specification. It handles different panel specifications like `PanelLib.isWithChild`, `PanelLib.isTransform`, and others, and renders the corresponding components accordingly.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ControlWrapper` component and how does it handle fullscreen functionality?
   **Answer:** The `ControlWrapper` component is responsible for wrapping the panel content and providing additional controls like fullscreen and dev query popup. It determines whether the fullscreen functionality should be enabled based on the panel path, panel's `canFullscreen` property, parent's fullscreen state, and config mode. It also provides a context for the fullscreen state and a function to toggle fullscreen mode.
