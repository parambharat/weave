The `PanelRun` component is a React functional component that renders a panel for displaying the output and logs of a running process. The component receives a `PanelRunProps` object as a prop, which contains a `panelConfig` object and an `input` object of type `run-type`. The `input` object is used to retrieve the output of the running process and display it in the panel.

The component first initializes a `consoleRef` reference to a `div` element, which is used to scroll to the bottom of the log output when new logs are added. It also initializes a `tab` state variable to keep track of which tab (log or output) is currently active.

The component then retrieves the `runQuery` object from the `input` prop using the `useValue` hook from the `hookUtils` module. The `useGatedValue` hook is used to prevent the component from rendering until the `runQuery` object is no longer loading. The `refresh` function is also retrieved from the `runQuery` object and is used to refresh the output of the running process.

The `outputNode` variable is then initialized using the `callOpVeryUnsafe` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. This function calls the `run-output` operation with the `self` parameter set to the `input` object. The `type` property of the resulting object is then set to the `_output` property of the `input` object. If the `runQuery` object is still loading or the state of the running process is `running`, the `voidNode` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module is returned instead.

The `usePanelStacksForType` hook is then used to retrieve the `handler` function for the output type of the running process. This function is used to render the output of the running process in a panel.

The `onScroll` function is defined to scroll to the bottom of the log output when new logs are added. The `useEffect` hook is used to set up a polling interval to refresh the output of the running process every 5 seconds. If the `runQuery` object is still loading or the state of the running process is `finished`, the polling interval is cleared.

Finally, the component renders the panel with two tabs: log and output. The `consoleRef` is used to render the log output in the log tab, and the `handler` function is used to render the output of the running process in the output tab. The `updateConfig` function is also passed down to the `PanelComp2` component to allow the user to update the panel configuration.

The `Spec` object exports the `PanelRun` component as a `PanelSpec` object with an `id` of `run` and an `inputType` of `run-type`. This allows the component to be registered as a panel in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelRun` component?
- The `PanelRun` component is a React functional component that renders a panel for displaying the output and logs of a running process.

2. What is the `usePanelStacksForType` hook used for?
- The `usePanelStacksForType` hook is used to retrieve the panel handler for a given output type.

3. Why is the `Poll` comment labeled as wrong?
- The `Poll` comment is labeled as wrong because each panel sets its own timer for polling, and this should be centralized instead.
