The `PanelTableMerge` component in this code is part of a larger project that deals with combining tables. The main purpose of this code is to provide a configuration panel for merging tables based on different methods and keys. The code provides a React component `PanelTableMergeConfig` that renders a configuration panel with options to select the method of combining tables (joining or concatenating), the style of joining (outer or inner), and the keys to be used for joining.

The code defines several utility functions and hooks to process the configuration, such as `getJoinKeys`, `useJoinKeys`, `getProcessedConfig`, `useProcessedConfig`, and `getAggregatedRowsNode`. These functions are used to determine the available join keys, process the configuration, and generate the final merged table based on the selected options.

For example, the `getJoinKeys` function takes an object type and an optional list of used keys, and returns an object containing all join keys, preferred join keys, and a map of joinable object paths. The `useJoinKeys` hook is a memoized version of this function.

The `getProcessedConfig` function takes the current configuration and input node, and returns a processed configuration object with smart defaults based on the input data. The `useProcessedConfig` hook is a memoized version of this function.

The `getAggregatedRowsNode` function takes the processed configuration and input node, and returns the final merged table based on the selected options.

The `PanelTableMergeConfig` component uses these hooks and functions to render the configuration panel and handle user interactions. When the user updates the configuration, the component calls the appropriate callback functions to update the configuration state.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and reusable component for configuring and merging tables in a larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PanelTableMerge` component and how does it work with the `PanelTableMergeConfig` component?

   **Answer**: The `PanelTableMerge` component is used to combine tables by either joining or concatenating rows based on the provided configuration. The `PanelTableMergeConfig` component is responsible for rendering the configuration options for the user to select the desired method of combining tables and the keys to be used for joining.

2. **Question**: How does the `getAggregatedRowsNode` function work and what are its parameters?

   **Answer**: The `getAggregatedRowsNode` function is responsible for combining rows based on the provided configuration. It takes four parameters: `compareMethod` (joining, concatenating, or none), `joinKeys` (an array of keys to be used for joining), `outer` (a boolean indicating whether to perform an outer or inner join), and `rowsOrListOfRows` (a node representing the input rows or list of rows). The function returns a new node with the combined rows based on the specified configuration.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `useProcessedConfig` hook and how is it used in the code?

   **Answer**: The `useProcessedConfig` hook is responsible for processing the provided configuration and generating a new configuration object with smart defaults based on the input data. It takes two parameters: `config` (the original configuration object) and `rowsOrListOfRows` (a node representing the input rows or list of rows). The hook is used in the `PanelTableMergeConfigInner` component to generate the processed configuration, which is then used to render the appropriate configuration options and perform the table merging operation.
