The `makeMigrator` function in the `weave` project generates a configuration migrator that can be used to migrate a configuration object from one version to another. The function takes in three generic type parameters: `FC`, `TC`, and `PC`, which represent the "from", "to", and "previous" configuration types, respectively. The `HasVersion` type is a type alias for an object that has a `configVersion` property of type `number`.

The function returns an object with two properties: `migrate` and `add`. The `migrate` function takes in a configuration object of type `PC`, `FC`, or `TC`, and returns a migrated configuration object of type `TC`. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property less than the specified `version`, the function will attempt to migrate the configuration object to the specified `version` using the `migratePrevious` function. If `migratePrevious` is not provided, an error will be thrown. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property equal to the specified `version`, the function will apply the specified migration function to the input configuration object and return the migrated configuration object with an incremented `configVersion` property. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property greater than the specified `version` plus one, an error will be thrown.

The `add` function takes in a migration function that migrates a configuration object from type `TC` to a new configuration type `CN`, and returns a new migrator object that can migrate from the original `FC` type to the new `CN` type. This allows for chaining of migration functions to migrate a configuration object through multiple versions.

The code includes an example usage of the `makeMigrator` function, where a series of migration functions are defined to migrate a configuration object from type `CV1` to type `CV4`. The `makeMigrator` function is used to generate a migrator object that applies the defined migration functions, and the `migrate` function is used to migrate a starting configuration object of type `CV1` to the final version `CV4`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HasVersion` type?
- The `HasVersion` type is an interface that requires an object to have a `configVersion` property of type `number`.

2. What is the purpose of the `makeMigrator` function?
- The `makeMigrator` function generates a config migrator that can be used to migrate a value from one version of a config to another. It takes in a migration function, a version number, and an optional function to migrate from a previous version.

3. How can the `makeMigrator` function be used to perform a migration?
- After creating a migrator with `makeMigrator`, the `migrate` method can be called with a starting config object to perform the migration. The migrator will apply any necessary migrations to the config object and return the resulting config object with an updated `configVersion`.
