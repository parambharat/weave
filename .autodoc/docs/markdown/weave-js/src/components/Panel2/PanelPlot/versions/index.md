This code exports various constants, types, and functions related to the weave project. The purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for accessing and using these resources throughout the project.

The file imports various modules from other files within the weave project, including migrator and several versions of a file called v. These modules contain functions and types related to data migration, plot configuration, and other aspects of the project.

The file exports several constants, including PLOT_DIMS_UI, MARK_OPTIONS, and DEFAULT_POINT_SIZE, which are used in plot configuration. It also exports several type definitions, such as PlotConfig and SeriesConfig, which are used to define the structure of plot configurations and series configurations, respectively.

The file also defines a function called migrateCommon, which is used to migrate plot configurations between different versions of the project. This function uses the makeMigrator function from the migrator module to create a migrator object, and then adds migration functions from various versions of the project to this object using the add method. Finally, the file exports a version of this migrator object that includes all of the migration functions.

Overall, this file provides a convenient way to access and use various resources related to plot configuration and data migration in the weave project. For example, other files in the project can import the constants and types defined in this file, or use the migrate function to migrate plot configurations between different versions of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `migrator` module and how is it used in this code?
   - The `migrator` module is used to migrate plot configurations from one version to another. It is used to create a `migrateCommon` object that adds migration functions for each version of the plot configuration.
2. What is the difference between `AnyPlotConfig` and `PlotConfig` types?
   - `AnyPlotConfig` is a union type that includes all possible plot configurations, while `PlotConfig` is the specific type for the migrated plot configuration.
3. What is the significance of the exported constants like `PLOT_DIMS_UI` and `DEFAULT_POINT_SIZE`?
   - These constants are used throughout the `weave` project to provide default values and options for various plot elements such as plot dimensions, point size, and line styles. They are exported for use in other modules that need to reference these values.
