This code imports the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library and exports a `ExpressionView` component that is a styled `span` element. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a pre-styled component that can be used to display expressions in the larger `weave` project. This component can be easily integrated into other components or pages within the project to display expressions in a consistent and visually appealing way. 

For example, in a math or programming related application, the `ExpressionView` component can be used to display mathematical or logical expressions. 

Here is an example of how the `ExpressionView` component can be used in a React component:

```
import React from 'react';
import { ExpressionView } from 'weave';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Math Expressions</h1>
      <ExpressionView>2 + 2 = 4</ExpressionView>
      <ExpressionView>x^2 + y^2 = r^2</ExpressionView>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `ExpressionView` component is used to display two math expressions in a `div` element. The expressions are automatically styled according to the default styles defined in the `ExpressionView` component. 

Overall, this code provides a useful and reusable component for displaying expressions in the `weave` project.
