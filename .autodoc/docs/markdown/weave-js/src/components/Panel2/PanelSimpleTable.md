The `PanelSimpleTable` component is a React functional component that renders a table based on the input data and configuration. It is used to display data in a tabular format with sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities. The component receives the input data and configuration as props and uses them to generate the table.

The component imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave` and `semantic-ui-react` libraries, as well as some custom modules from the project. It also defines a `PanelTable` type that specifies the input and state types for the component.

The `useWeaveContext` hook is used to get the `weave` object, which is an instance of the Weave client. The `input` and `config` props are used to generate the table rows and columns, respectively. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the rows and columns to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

The `PanelSimpleTable` component renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Table` component with the rows and columns generated from the input and configuration. The rows are generated by applying the filtering, grouping, and sorting functions specified in the configuration to the input data. The columns are generated by applying the column selection functions specified in the configuration to the rows.

The `PanelSimpleTable` component also supports pagination by using the `useEach` hook to render a subset of the rows based on the current page and page size specified in the configuration. The `useGatedValue` hook is used to prevent rendering the table until the rows are loaded.

Finally, the `PanelSimpleTable` component exports a `Spec` object that specifies the `id`, `Component`, and `inputType` for the component. This object is used by other parts of the project to register the component and use it in the UI.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { Spec as SimpleTableSpec } from './PanelSimpleTable';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const input = [{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 40 }];
  const config = { columns: { name: {}, age: {} } };
  return <SimpleTableSpec.Component input={input} config={config} />;
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a React component called `PanelSimpleTable` that renders a table based on input data and configuration settings. It uses various utility functions from other modules within the `weave` project.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code imports several modules from the `weave` project, as well as `React` and `semantic-ui-react`. It also uses custom hooks from the `../../context` and `../../hookUtils` files.

3. What is the expected input format for this component?
- The `PanelSimpleTable` component expects an input object with a `type` property set to `'list'` and an `objectType` property set to `'any'`. It also expects a `config` object with various properties defining the table's behavior and appearance.
