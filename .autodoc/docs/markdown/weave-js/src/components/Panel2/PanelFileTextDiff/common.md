The code in this file defines an object called `inputType` which is used to specify the types of input that can be accepted by the `weave` project. The `inputType` object is exported so that it can be used in other parts of the project.

The `inputType` object is defined as a union type, which means that it can accept multiple types of input. The `members` property of the object is an array of objects, each of which specifies a different type of input that can be accepted. 

Each object in the `members` array specifies a `list` type, which means that it can accept a list of files. The `objectType` property of each object specifies that the input should be a file with a specific extension. The extension is determined by iterating over the `EXTENSION_INFO` object in the `PanelFileText` module and extracting the keys.

Overall, this code is used to define the types of input that can be accepted by the `weave` project. It is likely that this object is used in other parts of the project to validate user input and ensure that the correct types of files are being used. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import { inputType } from 'weave';

// Validate user input
function validateInput(input) {
  if (inputType.members.some(member => {
    // Check if input matches any of the specified types
    return member.type === 'list' && input.every(file => {
      return file.type === 'file' && file.extension === member.objectType.extension;
    });
  })) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelFileText` import?
   - The `PanelFileText` import is used to access the `EXTENSION_INFO` object, which is used to generate the `members` array in the `inputType` object.

2. What is the expected format of the `inputType` object?
   - The `inputType` object is expected to have a `type` property with a value of `'union'`, and a `members` property that is an array of objects with a `type` property of `'list'` and an `objectType` property that is an object with a `type` property of `'file'`, an `extension` property, and a `wbObjectType` property with a value of `'none'`.

3. What is the purpose of the `map` function in the `members` array?
   - The `map` function is used to iterate over the keys of the `EXTENSION_INFO` object and generate an array of objects with the expected format for the `members` property of the `inputType` object.
