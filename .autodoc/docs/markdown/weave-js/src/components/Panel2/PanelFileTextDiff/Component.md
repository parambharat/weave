The `PanelFileTextCompare` component is a React functional component that renders a file comparison view for text files. It is part of the larger `weave` project and imports several dependencies from external libraries such as `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, `react`, `react-diff-viewer`, and `semantic-ui-react`. 

The component takes in a single prop, `inputType`, which is a type definition for the input data. The component then uses this input data to fetch the contents of the files to be compared and their sizes using the `opFileContents` and `opFileSize` functions respectively from the `@wandb/weave/core` library. 

The `PanelFileTextCompare` component then renders a `PanelFileTextCompareSizeGuard` component that checks if the size of any of the files to be compared exceeds a certain limit (25MB) and displays a warning message if so. If the files are within the size limit, the `PanelFileTextCompare` component renders a `PanelFileTextCompareContents` component that processes the file contents for display and renders a `ReactDiffViewer` component that displays the differences between the two files. 

The `PanelFileTextCompareViewer` component processes the file contents for display by splitting the files into lines and truncating lines that exceed a certain length (500 characters) or the total number of lines exceeds a certain limit (1000 lines). It then renders a `ReactDiffViewer` component that displays the differences between the two files using the `highlightSyntax` function to highlight the syntax of the files using the `prismjs` library. 

Overall, the `PanelFileTextCompare` component provides a simple and intuitive way to compare the contents of two text files and highlight their differences. It is a useful component for developers who need to compare the contents of two files and identify the differences between them. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import PanelFileTextCompare from 'weave/components/PanelFileTextCompare';

const input = {
  file: [
    {path: 'file1.txt', type: 'file'},
    {path: 'file2.txt', type: 'file'},
  ],
};

<PanelFileTextCompare input={input} />;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `PanelFileTextCompare` that displays the difference between two text files in a side-by-side view with syntax highlighting.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code imports several external libraries including `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `Prism`, `React`, `ReactDiffViewer`, and `semantic-ui-react`.

3. What are the limitations of the text view?
- The text view is limited to files less than 25 MB in size, and may truncate lines to 500 characters or limit the total number of lines to 1000 for display. If files are truncated, the diff display may not show all mismatches.
