The code above is a module that exports a constant object called `Spec`. This object is of type `Panel2.PanelSpec`, which is imported from the `../panel` module. The purpose of this object is to define the specifications for a panel component in the larger project called `weave`.

The `Spec` object has three properties: `id`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` property is a string that identifies the panel component as `PanelPlotly`. The `Component` property is a React component that is lazily loaded using the `React.lazy()` function. This component is imported from the `./Component` module, which is located in the same directory as this file. The `inputType` property is imported from the `./common` module and is used to specify the type of input that the panel component expects.

The purpose of this module is to define the specifications for a specific panel component in the `weave` project. The `PanelPlotly` component is a lazily loaded React component that expects a specific type of input. This module can be used in the larger project by importing the `Spec` object and using it to render the `PanelPlotly` component in the appropriate context.

Example usage:

```
import { Spec } from 'weave/panel-plotly';

// Render the PanelPlotly component with the specified input type
<Spec.Component inputType={Spec.inputType} />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?
   - The `Panel2` import is likely a module or component from another file in the `weave` project. It is used to define the `PanelSpec` object in this file.
2. What is the significance of the `inputType` variable and how is it used in this code?
   - The `inputType` variable is likely an object or function imported from another file in the `weave` project. It is used as a property of the `Spec` object, possibly to define the type of input that the `Component` expects.
3. Why is the `Component` property of the `Spec` object defined using `React.lazy` and `import` statements?
   - The use of `React.lazy` and `import` statements allows the `Component` to be loaded lazily, meaning it will only be loaded when it is actually needed. This can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application.
