The `AudioViewer` component is a React component that renders an audio player with a waveform visualization using the `wavesurfer.js` library. It takes in several props that allow customization of the player, such as the audio source, caption, and header element. 

The component initializes the `wavesurfer.js` object and sets up event listeners for various events such as play, pause, and seek. It also sets up state variables to keep track of the audio's loading status, playing status, and current and total time. 

The `AudioViewer` component renders a `Card` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library that contains the waveform visualization and a control bar with buttons for play/pause and download, as well as a display for the current and total time. The component also handles cases where the media fails to load, displaying a custom error message if provided. 

This component can be used in a larger project that requires audio playback functionality, such as a media player or a dashboard that displays audio data. It can be customized with different header elements and captions to fit the specific use case. 

Example usage:

```jsx
<AudioViewer
  audioSrc="https://example.com/audio.mp3"
  caption="Example audio"
  height={200}
  downloadFile={() => console.log('Downloading file')}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AudioViewer` component?
- The `AudioViewer` component is used to display an audio player with waveform visualization, play/pause controls, time display, and download button.

2. What external libraries are being used in this code?
- The code imports `WaveSurfer` from the `wavesurfer.js` library, and `Button` and `Card` from the `semantic-ui-react` library.

3. What is the purpose of the `useRef` hook in this code?
- The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the `WaveSurfer` object, which is used to manipulate the audio waveform visualization. It is also used to create a reference to the `waveformDomRef` element, which is the container for the waveform visualization.
