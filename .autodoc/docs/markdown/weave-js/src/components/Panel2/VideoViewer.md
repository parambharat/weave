The `VideoViewer` component in the `weave` project is a React component that renders a video player with additional features such as a play button, error handling, and loading placeholders. The component takes in several props such as `videoSrc`, `width`, `height`, `autoPlay`, and `muted`. 

The component first creates a reference to the video element using the `useRef` hook. It then uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the video's width, height, and whether the play button is visible. It also manages the state of whether the video has loaded or not and the height of the container element using the `useRef` hook. 

The component then uses the `useEffect` hook to handle the loading of the video. It creates a refresh handler to refresh the DOM node and unmutes the video if the `muted` prop is not set to `true`. It also sets the video to play automatically if the `autoPlay` prop is set to `true`. 

The component then uses the `useLayoutEffect` hook to check the height of the container element and the loading spinner. If there are no failures, the DOM will load first. 

The component then uses the `onLoaded` function to set the width and height of the video and sets the `videoLoaded` state to `true`. It also sets the `mediaStyles` object to contain the video and the `cardStyles` object to contain the card. 

The component then returns a `Card` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library with the `headerElement`, `content`, and `footerElement`. The `content` is a placeholder if the video has not loaded yet or if there is a media failure. If the video is a `.gif`, the component renders an `img` element. Otherwise, it renders a `video` element with a play button that toggles the video's play and pause state. 

The component also handles errors using the `setError` hook and the `getMediaErrorMessage` function. If there is an error, the component renders a `PanelError` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/elements/PanelError` library. 

Overall, the `VideoViewer` component is a reusable video player component with additional features such as error handling and loading placeholders. It can be used in the larger `weave` project to display videos and handle errors. 

Example usage:

```
<VideoViewer
  videoSrc="https://example.com/video.mp4"
  width={640}
  height={360}
  autoPlay={true}
  muted={true}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What are the required props for the VideoViewer component?
- The required props for the VideoViewer component are `videoSrc`, `width`, and `height`.

2. What does the `onError` function do?
- The `onError` function sets the `setDomLoadFailed` state to `true` and sets the `error` state to the error message if there is an error loading the video.

3. What does the `videoRefresh` function do?
- The `videoRefresh` function refreshes the video element by setting the `src` attribute to the `videoSrc` prop and setting the `currentTime` to the current time of the video element.
