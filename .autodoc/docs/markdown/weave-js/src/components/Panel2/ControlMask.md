The `ControlsMask` component in the `weave` project is responsible for rendering a control that toggles the visibility of an image overlay in a larger image display. The component takes in several props, including the current state of the mask control, a function to update the mask control state, the current state of the image overlay controls, and a function to update the image overlay controls. 

The component first extracts the `tileLayout` property from the `controls` prop, which determines the layout of the image display. If the layout is set to `ALL_SPLIT`, the component updates the `hideImage` property of the `mask` control state when the toggle button is clicked. Otherwise, it updates the `hideImage` property of the `controls` state. The `defaultHideImageState` function is used to determine the default value of `hideImage` based on the `tileLayout` property.

The `toggleImageVisibility` function is called when the toggle button is clicked. It first determines whether the layout is set to `ALL_SPLIT` and updates the `hideImage` property of the `mask` control state accordingly. Otherwise, it updates the `hideImage` property of the `controls` state. The `updateMask` and `updateControls` functions are used to update the respective control states with the new `hideImage` value.

Finally, the component renders a `WBIcon` component from the `@wandb/ui` library, which displays an icon for toggling the image overlay visibility. The color of the icon is set to grey if the image is currently hidden and black otherwise. When the icon is clicked, the `toggleImageVisibility` function is called to update the control state and re-render the component.

This component can be used in a larger image display component to allow users to toggle the visibility of image overlays. For example, in a medical imaging application, the image overlay could represent a segmentation mask that highlights certain regions of the image. The `ControlsMask` component would allow users to toggle the visibility of the mask to better visualize the underlying image. 

Example usage:

```
import { ControlsMask } from 'weave';

function ImageDisplay({ mask, updateMask, controls, updateControls }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src="path/to/image" alt="image" />
      <ControlsMask mask={mask} updateMask={updateMask} controls={controls} updateControls={updateControls} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ControlsMask` component?
- The `ControlsMask` component is used to render a control for toggling the visibility of an image overlay.

2. What is the significance of the `tileLayout` variable?
- The `tileLayout` variable is used to determine whether all image overlays are split or not, which affects how the image visibility toggle works.

3. What is the purpose of the `WBIcon` component?
- The `WBIcon` component is used to render an icon that represents the image visibility toggle control, and its color changes based on whether the image is currently hidden or not.
