The `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `PanelStringCompare`. This component is used to display a string comparison panel. The component takes in a set of props that are defined by the `PanelProps` type, which is generated based on the `inputType` object. The `inputType` object defines the expected input for the component, which is a union of two types: a dictionary object and a list object. Both types have an `objectType` property that is a union of two types: `string` and `none`. The list type also has a `maxLength` property that is set to 25.

The `PanelStringCompare` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to retrieve the value of the input. The retrieved value is then processed to generate a list of key-value pairs, which are displayed in a container. The component also includes a tooltip that displays the key-value pairs in a preformatted string. If the input is empty, the component displays a dash.

The `PanelStringCompare` component is exported as part of a `PanelSpec` object, which includes an `id` property set to `'string-compare'`, and a `Component` property set to `PanelStringCompare`. The `inputType` object is also included in the `PanelSpec` object.

This code can be used in the larger `weave` project to display string comparison panels for different types of input. The `inputType` object can be modified to support different types of input, and the `PanelStringCompare` component can be reused in different parts of the project. For example, the component can be used to display string comparisons in a data visualization dashboard or in a debugging tool.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelStringCompare` component?
- The `PanelStringCompare` component is used to render a string comparison panel based on the input type defined in `inputType`.

2. What is the significance of the `TooltipTrigger` component?
- The `TooltipTrigger` component is used to display a tooltip when the user hovers over the rendered string, and allows the user to copy the string content.

3. What is the role of the `useMemo` hook in this code?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `data` and `dataAsString` variables, which are derived from the `nodeValueQuery` variable. This helps to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders when the `nodeValueQuery` value changes.
