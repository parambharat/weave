This code is part of the larger project called "weave" and is divided into two parts. The first part is responsible for detecting the user's browser and exporting two constants, `isFirefox` and `isSafari`, which are set to `true` if the user is using Firefox or Safari, respectively. This information can be used in other parts of the project to provide browser-specific functionality or to handle browser-specific bugs.

The second part of the code exports a function called `skipTransition` that takes an HTML element and an optional `disableDuration` parameter. This function temporarily disables the CSS transition of the given element by setting its `transition` property to `'none'` and then restoring the original value after a specified duration. This can be useful when you want to skip a transition for a specific action, such as when you want to immediately hide an element without it fading out. 

Here's an example of how `skipTransition` can be used:

```javascript
import { skipTransition } from 'weave';

const element = document.getElementById('my-element');

// Disable the transition for 1 second
skipTransition(element, 1000);

// Immediately hide the element
element.style.display = 'none';
```

Overall, this code provides useful utility functions that can be used throughout the "weave" project to handle browser-specific behavior and to manipulate CSS transitions.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `detect` function imported from `detect-browser`?
   - The `detect` function is used to detect the user's browser and its properties.

2. What do the `isFirefox` and `isSafari` constants represent?
   - `isFirefox` and `isSafari` constants represent whether the user's browser is Firefox or Safari, respectively.

3. What does the `skipTransition` function do?
   - The `skipTransition` function disables the CSS transition of an HTML element for a specified duration.
