The code in this file provides utility functions and interfaces for pagination and layout calculations in the larger project. 

The `panelOnActivePage` function takes in a panel index, the current page number, and the number of panels per page, and returns a boolean indicating whether the panel is on the active page. This function can be used to determine which panels should be displayed on the current page of a paginated layout.

The `getPagingParams` function takes in container dimensions, the total number of panels, and a configuration object for the layout, and returns an object with parameters for pagination. These parameters include the number of panels per row, the number of panels per page, and the maximum page number. This function can be used to calculate the necessary pagination parameters for a given layout.

The `getBoxDimensions` function takes in container dimensions and a configuration object for the layout, and returns an object with the dimensions of each panel box. This function calculates the width and height of each panel box based on the number of columns and rows per page, as well as the gutter width and snap-to-columns setting. This function can be used to calculate the dimensions of each panel box in a layout.

The `getBoxDimension` function takes in container dimensions, gutter width, and the number of boxes per dimension, and returns the dimension of each box. This function calculates the width or height of each box based on the container dimensions, gutter width, and number of boxes per dimension. This function is used by `getBoxDimensions` to calculate the dimensions of each panel box.

The `getSnappedItemCount` and `getSnappedDimension` functions are used to calculate the number of items that can fit in a given container width and the corresponding dimension of each item. These functions take in the unsnapped pixel width, container pixel width, and gutter pixel width, and return the number of items that can fit in the container and the corresponding dimension of each item. These functions can be used to calculate the number of items that can fit in a container and the corresponding dimensions of each item in a layout.

The `isMobile` function returns a boolean indicating whether the current device is a mobile device based on the window width. This function can be used to determine whether to use a standard or custom box size for the layout.

Overall, this file provides utility functions and interfaces for pagination and layout calculations in the larger project. These functions can be used to calculate pagination parameters and panel box dimensions for a given layout, as well as to determine which panels should be displayed on the current page.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code provides various functions and interfaces related to pagination and box dimensions for the `weave` project, but it is unclear what the overall purpose of the project is.

2. What is the `PanelBankFlowSectionConfig` interface and where is it defined?
- The `PanelBankFlowSectionConfig` interface is imported from a file located at `./panelbank`, but it is unclear what properties it contains or how it is used.

3. What is the purpose of the `getSnappedItemCount` and `getSnappedDimension` functions?
- These functions appear to be related to determining the number of items that can fit in a container and the dimensions of those items, but it is unclear how they are used or what their specific purpose is within the `weave` project.
