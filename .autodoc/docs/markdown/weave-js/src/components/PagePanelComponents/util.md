The `weave` module provides various utility functions and types for the larger project. 

The `getConfig` function is imported from the `config` module located in the parent directory. It is used to retrieve the configuration settings for the project. 

The `getCookie` function is imported from the `@wandb/weave/common/util/cookie` module. It is used to retrieve the value of a cookie with a given name. 

The `NodeOrVoidNode`, `Type`, `isAssignableTo` types are imported from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. They are used to define types and check if a given type is assignable to another type. 

The `fetch` function is imported from the `isomorphic-unfetch` module. It is used to make HTTP requests. 

The `useEffect` and `useState` hooks are imported from the `react` module. They are used to manage state and side effects in React components. 

The `REMOTE_URI_PREFIX` and `LOCAL_URI_PREFIX` constants are defined as strings. They are used to identify whether a given URI is a remote or local artifact. 

The `isRemoteURI` and `isLocalURI` functions are defined to check if a given URI is a remote or local artifact. 

The `BranchPointType` type is defined to represent a branch point in the artifact history. It contains the commit hash, number of commits, and original URI of the artifact. 

The `inJupyterCell` function is defined to check if the code is running in a Jupyter notebook cell. 

The `btoa` function is declared to encode a string in base64. 

The `useIsAuthenticated` function is defined to check if the user is authenticated. It makes a POST request to the backend with the anonymous API key and sets the `isAuth` state accordingly. 

The `isServedLocally` function is defined to check if the code is being served locally. 

The `uriFromNode` function is defined to extract the URI from a given node. 

The `branchPointIsRemote` function is defined to check if the branch point is a remote artifact. 

The `weaveTypeIsPanel` and `weaveTypeIsPanelGroup` functions are defined to check if a given weave type is a panel or panel group. 

The `toArtifactSafeName` function is defined to replace any non-alphanumeric characters in a string with underscores. 

The `entityNameFromRemoteURI` function is defined to extract the entity and project names from a remote URI. 

The `determineURISource` function is defined to determine the source of the URI (entity and project names) based on the URI and branch point. 

The `determineURIIdentifier` function is defined to determine the name and version of the artifact based on the URI. 

The `getPathFromURI` function is defined to extract the path from a given URI. 

Overall, this module provides various utility functions and types that are used throughout the larger project to manage artifacts and check user authentication.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useIsAuthenticated` function?
- The `useIsAuthenticated` function is used to check if the user is authenticated by making a POST request to the backendWeaveViewerUrl and setting the state of `isAuth` accordingly.

2. What is the purpose of the `determineURISource` function?
- The `determineURISource` function is used to determine the entity and project name from a remote URI.

3. What is the purpose of the `weaveTypeIsPanelGroup` function?
- The `weaveTypeIsPanelGroup` function is used to check if a given weaveType is assignable to a `Group` type.
