The `weave` project contains a module that provides several hooks for working with code artifacts. The code in this file defines several React hooks that can be used to interact with code artifacts stored in various locations.

The `useBranchPointFromURIString` hook takes a URI string and returns a `BranchPointType` object that represents the branch point of the code artifact. The `usePreviousVersionFromURIString` hook takes a URI string and returns the URI of the previous version of the code artifact. Both hooks use the `useMemo` and `useNodeValue` hooks from the `@wandb/weave/react` module to memoize and retrieve the results of the operations.

The `useGetCodeFromURI` hook takes a URI string and returns a function that retrieves the code for the artifact from the server. The `useCopyCodeFromURI` hook takes a URI string and returns an object with a `copyStatus` property that indicates the status of the copy operation (either "ready", "loading", "success", or "error") and an `onCopy` function that copies the code to the clipboard.

These hooks can be used in a larger project to provide functionality for working with code artifacts. For example, the `useBranchPointFromURIString` hook could be used to display the branch point of a code artifact in a UI, while the `useCopyCodeFromURI` hook could be used to provide a "Copy Code" button that copies the code to the clipboard.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?
- This code is part of the `weave` project, but it is unclear what the project does or what its goals are.

2. What do the functions `useBranchPointFromURIString` and `usePreviousVersionFromURIString` do?
- `useBranchPointFromURIString` and `usePreviousVersionFromURIString` take a URI string as input and return either a `BranchPointType` or a `string`, respectively. It is unclear what these types represent or how they are used.

3. What is the purpose of the `useCopyCodeFromURI` function and how is it used?
- `useCopyCodeFromURI` returns an object with a `copyStatus` property and an `onCopy` function. It is unclear how this function is intended to be used or what its purpose is.
