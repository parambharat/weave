The code in this file provides a set of utility functions for working with 3D vectors represented as arrays of three numbers. These functions can be used in the larger project to perform common vector operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and magnitude calculation.

The `clamp` function takes a vector `value` and a range defined by a low and high vector, and returns a new vector where each component is clamped to the corresponding range. For example, if `value` is `[1, 2, 3]` and the range is `[0, 2, 4]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3]` because all components are within the range. If `value` is `[3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `[2, 2, 4]` because the first two components are clamped to the range `[0, 2]` and the last component is clamped to the range `[0, 4]`.

The `makeVec3` function takes a scalar `x` and returns a new vector where all components are equal to `x`. This can be useful for initializing vectors with a default value.

The `add` function takes two vectors `x` and `y` and returns a new vector that is the result of adding the corresponding components of `x` and `y`. For example, if `x` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `y` is `[4, 5, 6]`, the function will return `[5, 7, 9]`.

The `sub` function takes two vectors `x` and `y` and returns a new vector that is the result of subtracting the corresponding components of `y` from `x`. For example, if `x` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `y` is `[4, 5, 6]`, the function will return `[-3, -3, -3]`.

The `mag` function takes a vector `x` and returns its magnitude, which is the length of the vector. This is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: the magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the components. For example, if `x` is `[1, 2, 2]`, the function will return `3`.

The `mul` function takes a vector `x` and a scalar `y` and returns a new vector that is the result of multiplying each component of `x` by `y`. For example, if `x` is `[1, 2, 3]` and `y` is `2`, the function will return `[2, 4, 6]`.

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to work with 3D vectors in the larger project, allowing for common operations to be performed easily and efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `clamp` function?
- The `clamp` function takes a vector `value` and clamps its values between the corresponding values in the `low` and `high` vectors, and returns the resulting vector.

2. What does the `makeVec3` function do?
- The `makeVec3` function takes a scalar `x` and returns a vector with all three components set to `x`.

3. What is the `mag` function used for?
- The `mag` function calculates and returns the magnitude (length) of the input vector `x`.
