The `clamp` function in the `weave` project takes in a number value and an optional object of `ClampParams` which contains a minimum and/or maximum value. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the input value falls within the specified range, and if it doesn't, it will be clamped to the nearest boundary. 

The `ClampParams` type is defined as an object with two optional properties: `min` and `max`, both of which are numbers. If `min` is provided, the input value will be compared to it and if it is less than `min`, the value will be set to `min`. Similarly, if `max` is provided, the input value will be compared to it and if it is greater than `max`, the value will be set to `max`. If both `min` and `max` are provided, the input value will be clamped between them.

This function can be used in a variety of scenarios where a value needs to be constrained within a certain range. For example, in a game development project, the `clamp` function could be used to ensure that a player's health value never falls below 0 or goes above a certain maximum value. 

Here is an example of how the `clamp` function could be used:

```
import clamp from 'weave';

const health = 75;
const minHealth = 0;
const maxHealth = 100;

const clampedHealth = clamp(health, {min: minHealth, max: maxHealth});

console.log(clampedHealth); // Output: 75

const newHealth = -10;

const clampedNewHealth = clamp(newHealth, {min: minHealth, max: maxHealth});

console.log(clampedNewHealth); // Output: 0
```

In this example, the `clamp` function is used to ensure that the `health` value falls within the range of `minHealth` and `maxHealth`. The first `console.log` statement outputs `75` because the `health` value is already within the specified range. The second `console.log` statement outputs `0` because the `newHealth` value is less than the `minHealth` value, so it is clamped to `minHealth`.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `clamp` function do?
   - The `clamp` function takes a number value and an optional object with `min` and `max` properties, and returns the clamped value within the range of `min` and `max` if they are provided.

2. What is the purpose of the `ClampParams` type?
   - The `ClampParams` type is used to define the shape of the object that can be passed as the second argument to the `clamp` function. It specifies that the object can have optional `min` and `max` number properties.

3. What happens if both `min` and `max` are not provided in the `ClampParams` object?
   - If both `min` and `max` are not provided in the `ClampParams` object, the `clamp` function will simply return the original value passed as the first argument without any clamping.
