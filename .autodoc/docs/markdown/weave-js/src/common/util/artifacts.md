This file contains a set of utility functions and interfaces related to artifacts and their labels. 

The `ArtifactLabels` interface defines a dictionary where each key is a string and its value is an array of strings. This interface is used to represent the labels of an artifact.

The `Label` interface defines an object with two properties: `key` and `val`, both of which are strings. This interface is used to represent a single label.

The `parseArtifactTypeDescription` function takes a string as input and returns an object with two properties: `description` and `schema`. The input string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the `description` property. The remaining lines are joined together to form the `schema` property. If the input string is null or empty, both properties are set to undefined.

The `createArtifactTypeDescription` function takes a `description` string and an optional `schema` string as input and returns a string. The `description` string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the first line of the output string. If the `schema` string is not null, it is appended to the output string with a newline character.

The `parseArtifactLabels` function takes a string as input and returns an object of type `ArtifactLabels`. The input string is expected to be a JSON-encoded string. If the input string is not valid JSON, an empty object is returned.

The `parseLabelString` function takes a string of the form "key:value" as input and returns an object of type `Label`. If the input string is not in the expected format, the `key` and `val` properties of the returned object are set to empty strings.

The `newLabelValid` function takes a `Label` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `key` property has a length greater than 2 and the `val` property is not empty.

The `newAliasValid` function takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is not empty.

The `artifactNiceName` function takes an artifact object and an optional options object as input and returns a string. The output string is of the form "artifactSequence.name:digest" or "artifactSequence.name:commitHash" if `versionIndex` is null. If `versionIndex` is not null, the output string is of the form "artifactSequence.name:vversionIndex". If `shortenDigest` is true, the `digest` property is shortened to the first 6 characters.

The `artifactMembershipNiceName` function takes a `collectionName` string and an identifier object as input and returns a string of the form "collectionName:alias". The `alias` property is determined based on the properties of the input identifier object.

The `isVersionAlias` function takes an object with an `alias` property as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` property is of the form "vX", where X is a positive integer.

The `getDescriptionSummary` function takes an artifact description string as input and returns the first line of the string.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ArtifactLabels` and `Label` interfaces?
- The `ArtifactLabels` interface defines a dictionary object where the keys are strings and the values are arrays of strings. The `Label` interface defines an object with `key` and `val` properties, both of which are strings.

2. What do the `parseArtifactTypeDescription` and `createArtifactTypeDescription` functions do?
- `parseArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a string and returns an object with `description` and `schema` properties. If the input string is null or empty, the function returns default values. `createArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a `description` string and an optional `schema` string, and returns a concatenated string with a newline character between the two.

3. What is the purpose of the `isVersionAlias` function?
- The `isVersionAlias` function takes in an object with an `alias` property and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` matches a specific regular expression pattern (`/^v(\d+)$/`). This is used to determine if the alias represents a version number.
