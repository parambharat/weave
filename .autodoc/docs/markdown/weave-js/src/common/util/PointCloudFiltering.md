The `weave` project includes a file that exports several functions and constants related to filtering and rendering 3D bounding boxes. The file imports several components and functions from other files in the project, including `AllBoundingBoxControls`, `BoundingBoxSliderControl`, `compare`, `BabylonPointCloud`, and `SceneBox`. 

The `getEmptyFilter` function returns an object with three properties: `hiddenBoundingBoxLabels`, `hideAllBoxes`, and `score`. The `Filter` interface defines these properties as well. `hiddenBoundingBoxLabels` is an array of strings representing the labels of bounding boxes that should be hidden. `hideAllBoxes` is a boolean indicating whether all bounding boxes should be hidden. `score` is an object of type `BoundingBoxSliderControl` that represents a slider control for filtering bounding boxes based on a score. 

The `getFilterFromBBoxConfig` function takes a `boundingBoxConfig` object and a `classIdToLabel` map as arguments and returns a `Filter` object. The `boundingBoxConfig` object is an instance of `AllBoundingBoxControls` that contains information about the bounding boxes to be rendered. The `classIdToLabel` map is a map of class IDs to labels. The function extracts the `classIdControl` object from the `boundingBoxConfig` object and uses it to populate the `hiddenBoundingBoxLabels` array. The function also sets the `hideAllBoxes` property based on the `ALL_LABEL` property of `classIdControl`. Finally, the function sets the `score` property based on the `sliders` property of `boundingBoxConfig`. 

The `isBoundingBoxVisible` function takes a `box` object and a `filter` object as arguments and returns a boolean indicating whether the bounding box should be visible. The function first checks whether all bounding boxes should be hidden based on the `hideAllBoxes` property of the `filter` object. If so, the function returns `false`. The function then checks whether the bounding box's label is in the `hiddenBoundingBoxLabels` array of the `filter` object. If so, the function returns `false`. Finally, the function checks whether the bounding box's score meets the criteria specified in the `score` property of the `filter` object. If so, the function returns `true`. 

The `applyFilter` function takes a `data` object of type `BabylonPointCloud` and a `filter` object of type `Filter` as arguments and returns a new `BabylonPointCloud` object with the same `points` and `vectors` properties as the original `data` object but with the `boxes` property filtered based on the `filter` object using the `isBoundingBoxVisible` function. 

Overall, this file provides functions and interfaces for filtering and rendering 3D bounding boxes in the `weave` project. The `getFilterFromBBoxConfig` function is particularly useful for extracting a `Filter` object from an `AllBoundingBoxControls` object, which is used to render the bounding boxes. The `isBoundingBoxVisible` function is used to determine whether a bounding box should be rendered based on the `Filter` object. The `applyFilter` function applies the `Filter` object to a `BabylonPointCloud` object to render only the visible bounding boxes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getFilterFromBBoxConfig` function?
- The `getFilterFromBBoxConfig` function takes in a bounding box configuration and a map of class IDs to labels, and returns a filter object that can be used to filter boxes based on their labels and scores.

2. What is the difference between `Filter` and `getEmptyFilter`?
- `Filter` is an interface that defines the shape of a filter object, while `getEmptyFilter` is a function that returns an empty filter object with default values for its properties.

3. What is the purpose of the `applyFilter` function?
- The `applyFilter` function takes in a BabylonPointCloud object and a filter object, and returns a new BabylonPointCloud object with only the boxes that pass the filter.
