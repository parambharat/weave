The `weave` project is a JavaScript library that provides various utilities for data visualization. The code in this file provides a function called `displayValueNoBarChart` that takes in a value and returns a string or a React element that can be used to display the value in a UI. 

The function first checks if the value is a string that represents a JSON object. If so, it attempts to parse the string into a JSON object. If the parsing fails, the function leaves the value as a string. 

Next, the function checks if the value is null or undefined. If so, it returns a dash ("-") to indicate that the value is missing. If the value is a number, the function formats it based on its size and precision. If the value is a string, the function checks if it represents a URL or a block of Markdown-formatted text. If it's a URL, the function returns a link element that displays the first 25 characters of the URL. If it's Markdown, the function returns a React component that renders the Markdown as HTML. Otherwise, the function returns the original string. 

Finally, if the value is an object with a `_type` property, the function returns the value of the `_type` property. This is used to display the type of certain objects, such as images. If the value is any other type of object, the function returns a JSON string representation of the object. 

This function can be used in various parts of the `weave` project to display data values in a user-friendly way. For example, it could be used to display the values of data points in a chart or table. Here's an example usage of the function:

```javascript
import { displayValueNoBarChart } from 'weave';

const value = 123.456;
const displayValue = displayValueNoBarChart(value);
console.log(displayValue); // "123.456"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code imports the lodash, numeral, and React libraries.

2. What does the `displayValueNoBarChart` function do?
- This function takes in a value and returns a string or React element that represents the value. It handles various types of values, including numbers, strings, and objects with a `_type` property.

3. What is the purpose of the `isMarkdown` function?
- This function checks if a given string is a markdown code block by checking if it starts and ends with triple backticks and has a length of at least 6. It returns a boolean value.
