The `weave` project contains a file that exports three functions: `makeShouldUpdate`, `makeDidPropsOrStateChange`, and `makePropsAreEqual`. These functions are used to create helper functions that determine whether a React component should update based on changes to its props or state.

The `makeShouldUpdate` function takes a `spec` object as an argument, which contains various options for how to compare props. The function returns a `checker` function that takes three arguments: `props`, `nextProps`, and `extra`. The `props` and `nextProps` arguments are objects containing the current and next props, respectively. The `extra` argument is an optional string that can be used to provide additional information about the component being checked.

The `checker` function iterates over the keys of `nextProps` and compares each key to the corresponding key in `props`. If the key is in the `ignoreFunctions` or `ignoreJSX` arrays in the `spec` object, or if it is in the `ignore` array, the comparison is skipped. If the key is in the `deep` array, a deep comparison is performed using `_.isEqualWith`. Otherwise, a shallow comparison is performed using `===`. The results of the comparisons are stored in a `result` object, which is used to determine whether the component should update.

If the `debug` option is set to `true` in the `spec` object and the `shouldUpdate` variable is `true`, the function logs information about the props that have changed. If the `verbose` option is also set to `true`, the function logs additional information about the props that have changed, including the before and after values and any differences between them.

The `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` function is similar to `makeShouldUpdate`, but it compares both props and state. The `spec` object is the same as in `makeShouldUpdate`, but the `deep` key is only used for props. The function returns a `checker` function that takes three arguments: `props`, `state`, and `extra`. The `props` and `state` arguments are arrays of things to compare, like `[this.props, nextProps]` and `[this.state, nextState]`, respectively.

The `makePropsAreEqual` function takes a `spec` object as an argument and returns a function that compares two sets of props and returns `true` if they are equal. The function uses `makeShouldUpdate` to create a `didPropsUpdate` function, which it then uses to compare the props.

These functions can be used in a React component's `shouldComponentUpdate` method to determine whether the component should update based on changes to its props or state. For example:

```
import React from 'react';
import {makeDidPropsOrStateChange} from 'weave';

const mySpec = {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  deep: ['foo', 'bar'],
  ignore: ['baz'],
  ignoreFunctions: true,
  ignoreJSX: true,
  debug: true,
  verbose: true,
};

const didPropsOrStateChange = makeDidPropsOrStateChange(mySpec);

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return didPropsOrStateChange([this.props, nextProps], [this.state, nextState], 'MyComponent');
  }

  render() {
    // ...
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `makeShouldUpdate` function?
- The `makeShouldUpdate` function is a helper function that checks if a component's props have changed and returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should update or not.

2. What is the difference between `makeShouldUpdate` and `makeDidPropsOrStateChange`?
- `makeShouldUpdate` only compares props, while `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` compares both props and state. `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` uses `makeShouldUpdate` internally to compare props.

3. What is the purpose of the `makePropsAreEqual` function?
- The `makePropsAreEqual` function returns a function that can be used as the `arePropsEqual` argument in `React.memo()`. This function checks if the props of two components are equal and returns a boolean value indicating whether the components should be re-rendered or not.
