The `weave` project is a JavaScript library that provides a set of tools for working with text and HTML. This file, located at `weave`, contains a set of functions that are used to convert Markdown to HTML and vice versa, as well as to sanitize HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

The `generateHTML` function takes a Markdown string as input and returns an HTML string. It uses the `unified` library to parse the Markdown, apply various plugins to it (such as `math`, `emoji`, and `katex`), and then convert it to HTML using the `remark2rehype` and `stringify` plugins. The resulting HTML is then sanitized using the `sanitize` plugin from the `rehype-sanitize` library to remove any potentially dangerous elements or attributes. Finally, the `blankifyLinks` and `shiftHeadings` functions are applied to the resulting HTML string to modify it further.

The `sanitizeHTML` function takes an HTML string as input and returns a sanitized version of it. It uses the `parseHTML` and `stringify` plugins from the `rehype-parse` and `rehype-stringify` libraries, respectively, to parse and stringify the HTML, and then applies the `sanitize` plugin to sanitize it.

The `markdownToText` function takes a Markdown string as input and returns a plain text version of it. It first generates an HTML string from the Markdown using the `generateHTML` function, and then extracts the text content of the resulting HTML using a temporary `div` element.

The `centerText` function is a plugin for the `unified` library that converts text in the Markdown syntax `-> Text <-` to a centered node in the resulting HTML. It works at the paragraph level, allowing links to be embedded within the centered text.

The `isMarkdown` function is a heuristic that attempts to determine whether a given string is in the Markdown syntax. It checks for various patterns that are commonly used in Markdown, such as headings, bold and italic text, links, lists, code blocks, and blockquotes.

Overall, this file provides a set of useful functions for working with Markdown and HTML in the `weave` project. The `generateHTML` and `sanitizeHTML` functions are particularly important for converting between the two formats and ensuring that the resulting HTML is safe to use.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `sanitizeRules` object?
- The `sanitizeRules` object is used to define the allowed attributes for HTML elements when sanitizing HTML content to prevent XSS attacks.

2. What is the purpose of the `centerText` function?
- The `centerText` function is a plugin that converts text surrounded by `->` and `<-` to a centered node in the markdown syntax.

3. What is the purpose of the `isMarkdown` function?
- The `isMarkdown` function is a heuristic function that attempts to determine if a given string is in markdown format by checking for patterns commonly found in markdown syntax.
