The `weave` project contains a module that provides utility functions for working with links in React applications. The module exports several functions and components that can be used to create links with various properties.

The `linkify` function takes a string and an object of properties to apply to the resulting links. It searches the string for URLs and Markdown-style links, and returns an array of strings and JSX elements. Each element in the array represents a portion of the original string or a JSX element containing a link. The original order of the string is preserved. For example, the input string "See my website at http://mywebsite.com and leave a comment!" would yield the following output: `['See my website at ', <a href.../>, ' and leave a comment!']`. The `linkify` function can be used to automatically convert URLs and Markdown-style links in text to clickable links.

The `TargetBlank` component is a memoized version of an anchor tag that opens links in a new tab. It enforces an absolute prefixed URL for blank targets, and sets the `target` and `rel` attributes of the anchor tag to `_blank`, `noopener`, and `noreferrer`, respectively. The `Link` component is a memoized version of a React Router `Link` component that can be used to create links within the application. It takes an optional `RRLinkComp` prop that can be used to specify a different component to use for the link. If the `to` prop of the `Link` component is a string that starts with `http` or `//`, the link is treated as an external link and opened in a new tab by default. The `NavLink` component is a memoized version of a React Router `NavLink` component that can be used to create links with active styling.

The `LinkNoCrawl` component is a memoized version of an anchor tag that prevents search engines from following the link until the user interacts with it. It takes an optional `LinkComp` prop that can be used to specify a different component to use for the link. The component uses the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks to keep track of whether the user has interacted with the link. If the user has not interacted with the link, the component returns an anchor tag with the same properties as the original component. If the user has interacted with the link, the component returns the specified `LinkComp` component with the same properties as the original component.

The `getHREFFromAbsoluteURL` function takes an absolute URL and returns the URL with the `https` protocol added if it is not already present. This function can be used to ensure that external links are always served over a secure connection.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `linkify` function?
- The `linkify` function takes a string that might have URLs in it and returns an array where each element is a portion of the original string or a JSX element containing one of the links, with the original ordering preserved.

2. What is the purpose of the `TargetBlank` component?
- The `TargetBlank` component enforces an absolute prefixed URL for blank targets and renders an anchor element with `target="_blank"` attribute and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute.

3. What is the purpose of the `getHREFFromAbsoluteURL` function?
- The `getHREFFromAbsoluteURL` function takes an absolute URL and returns the same URL if it starts with `http`, otherwise it returns the URL with `https://` prefix.
