The `weave` project includes a module that provides color-related functionality. The module exports several functions and constants that can be used throughout the project.

The `colorN` function takes an index and a palette of colors and returns a color from the palette based on the index. If an alpha value is provided, it sets the alpha value of the returned color to the provided value. If no alpha value is provided, it uses the alpha value of the color from the palette. The function uses the `Color` class from the `color` library to manipulate colors.

The `colorNRGB` function is similar to `colorN`, but it returns an RGB array instead of a string. This function can be useful when working with libraries that require RGB values instead of color strings.

The `ROBIN16` constant is an array of 16 colors in a specific order. This order is used in other parts of the project, so it is defined as a constant to ensure consistency.

The `GLOBAL_COLORS` constant is an object that defines several colors used throughout the project. These colors are defined using the `Color` class and values from the `globals.styles` module.

The `colorFromString` function takes a string representation of a color and returns an RGB array. This function can be useful when working with color values that are stored as strings.

The `hashString` function takes a string and returns a hash value. This function is used by the `colorFromName` function to generate an index value based on a string. The `colorFromName` function takes a string and an optional alpha value and returns a color from the `COLORS16` palette based on the hash value of the string. This function can be useful when generating colors based on names or other string values.

Overall, this module provides a set of functions and constants that can be used to work with colors in the `weave` project. The `Color` class from the `color` library is used extensively to manipulate colors, and the `hashString` function is used to generate index values for the `colorFromName` function.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `colorN` function?
- The `colorN` function takes an index and a palette of colors and returns a color from the palette based on the index, with an optional alpha value.

2. What is the difference between the `colorN` and `colorNRGB` functions?
- The `colorN` function returns a color as a string in RGB format, while the `colorNRGB` function returns a color as an array of RGB values.

3. What is the purpose of the `hashString` function?
- The `hashString` function takes a string and returns a hash value, which is used to generate an index for selecting a color from the `COLORS16` palette in the `colorFromName` function.
