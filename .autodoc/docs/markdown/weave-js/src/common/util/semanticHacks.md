This code provides a solution for a specific issue that may arise when using the `semantic-ui-react` library in conjunction with the `weave` project. Specifically, if a `WBMenu` or other `WB*` component is used inside of a `semantic-ui-react` `Popup`, clicking on a menu item will dismiss the `Popup`, which is not the desired behavior. 

To address this issue, the code defines a constant `BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME` which can be added as a class to the `WBMenu` or any of its ancestors that end up in the portal `WBMenu` creates. Then, the `withIgnoreBlockedClicks` function is provided as a solution to be used as the `onClose` method of the `Popup` that needs to be fixed. 

The `withIgnoreBlockedClicks` function takes a `PopupOnCloseFn` as its argument, which is a non-nullable function that is defined in the `PopupProps` type from `semantic-ui-react`. The function then returns a wrapped version of the `PopupOnCloseFn` that checks if the event target is a descendant of an element with the `BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME` class. If it is, the function returns without executing the original `PopupOnCloseFn`. If it is not, the original `PopupOnCloseFn` is executed with the provided `event` and `data` arguments. 

Overall, this code provides a simple solution to a specific issue that may arise when using `semantic-ui-react` and `weave` together. By adding the `BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME` class to the appropriate elements and using the `withIgnoreBlockedClicks` function as the `onClose` method of the affected `Popup`, the desired behavior can be achieved. 

Example usage:

```
import { Popup } from 'semantic-ui-react';
import { BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME, withIgnoreBlockedClicks } from 'weave';

const MyPopup = () => {
  const handleClose = withIgnoreBlockedClicks((event, data) => {
    console.log('Popup closed');
  });

  return (
    <Popup
      trigger={<button>Open Popup</button>}
      content={<div className={BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME}><WBMenu /></div>}
      onClose={handleClose}
    />
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
    
    This code provides a solution for preventing a semantic Popup from being dismissed when clicking on a menu item within a WBMenu or other WB* components.

2. What is the BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME used for?
    
    The BLOCK_POPUP_CLICKS_CLASSNAME is a class that should be added to the menu or any of its ancestors that end up in the portal WBMenu creates, in order to prevent the Popup from being dismissed when clicking on a menu item.

3. What does the withIgnoreBlockedClicks function do?
    
    The withIgnoreBlockedClicks function takes a PopupOnCloseFn function as an argument and returns a new function that wraps the original function. The new function checks if the event target is within an element with the class 'block-popup-clicks', and if so, it returns without calling the original function. Otherwise, it calls the original function with the event and data arguments.
