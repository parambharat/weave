This code defines a set of CSS classes that use custom icons for various purposes. The icons are represented using Unicode characters and are assigned to the `content` property of each class. 

These icons can be used throughout the larger project to provide visual cues and improve the user experience. For example, the `icon-edit` class could be used to indicate that a particular element on the page is editable, while the `icon-trash` class could be used to indicate that an element can be deleted. 

To use these icons, a developer would simply need to add the appropriate class to the HTML element they want to display the icon next to. For example, to display the `icon-edit` icon next to a button, the developer would add the class `icon-edit` to the button's HTML tag:

```
<button class="icon-edit">Edit</button>
```

Overall, this code serves as a useful resource for the project by providing a consistent set of custom icons that can be used throughout the user interface.
