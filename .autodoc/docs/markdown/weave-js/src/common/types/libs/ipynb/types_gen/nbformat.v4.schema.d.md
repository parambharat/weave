This file contains TypeScript interfaces and types that define the JSON schema for Jupyter Notebook v4.5. The `NbformatV4Schema` interface is the root-level interface that defines the structure of a Jupyter Notebook. It has three properties: `metadata`, `nbformat_minor`, and `cells`. 

The `metadata` property is an object that contains information about the notebook, such as the kernel information, the notebook's title, and the author(s) of the notebook. The `nbformat_minor` property is a number that represents the minor version of the notebook format. The `cells` property is an array of `Cell` objects, which can be one of three types: `RawCell`, `MarkdownCell`, or `CodeCell`. 

Each of these cell types has a unique structure defined by its respective interface. `RawCell` represents a raw nbconvert cell, which is a cell that has not been converted to any other format. `MarkdownCell` represents a cell that contains Markdown-formatted text. `CodeCell` represents a cell that contains executable code. 

The `Output` type is used to represent the output of a `CodeCell`. It can be one of four types: `ExecuteResult`, `DisplayData`, `Stream`, or `Error`. `ExecuteResult` represents the result of executing a code cell. `DisplayData` represents data that is displayed as a result of code cell execution. `Stream` represents output from a code cell that is streamed to either stdout or stderr. `Error` represents an error that occurred during code cell execution.

Overall, this file provides a comprehensive definition of the structure of a Jupyter Notebook in JSON format. It can be used to validate and parse Jupyter Notebook files, as well as to generate TypeScript interfaces for working with Jupyter Notebooks in a TypeScript project. 

Example usage:

```typescript
import { NbformatV4Schema } from 'weave';

const notebookJson = '{"metadata": {...}, "nbformat_minor": 5, "nbformat": 4, "cells": [...] }';
const notebook: NbformatV4Schema = JSON.parse(notebookJson);

console.log(notebook.metadata.title); // logs the title of the notebook
console.log(notebook.cells[0].cell_type); // logs the type of the first cell in the notebook
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- As a code documentation expert, I cannot determine the purpose of the `weave` project based on the provided code alone. 

2. What is the structure of a notebook file in the `NbformatV4Schema` interface?
- The `NbformatV4Schema` interface defines the structure of a Jupyter Notebook v4.5 JSON schema, which includes root-level metadata, notebook format (minor and major numbers), and an array of cells. Each cell can be of type `RawCell`, `MarkdownCell`, or `CodeCell`, and has an id, cell_type, metadata, and source. 

3. What are the different types of outputs that can be produced by a code cell?
- A code cell can produce four different types of outputs: `ExecuteResult`, `DisplayData`, `Stream`, and `Error`. Each output type has its own interface that defines its structure and properties.
