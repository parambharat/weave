This file defines various interfaces and types related to media metadata, such as images, audio, tables, and HTML. It also includes utility functions for working with bounding boxes and media types.

The `ImageMetadata` interface defines the properties of an image, including its dimensions, format, and captions. The `LayoutType` type specifies the layout of images in the UI. The `ManyMasks` and `ManyBoxes` interfaces define objects that contain multiple masks or bounding boxes, respectively. The `BoundingBoxFileData` interface specifies the data for a bounding box file, including the box data and class labels. The `Mask` interface defines a mask and its associated class labels.

The `BoundingBox2D` and `BoundingBox3D` interfaces define 2D and 3D bounding boxes, respectively. The `returnIfBoundingBox2D` and `returnIfBoundingBox3D` functions return the appropriate type of bounding box based on its type property.

The `AudioMetadata` interface defines the properties of an audio file, including its sample rate and duration. The `TableMetadata` interface specifies the columns and data of a table. The `HtmlMetadata` interface defines the properties of an HTML file. The `MediaCardMetadata` interface specifies the dimensions and grouping of a media card.

The `MediaString` and `MediaCardString` types define the different types of media that can be displayed in the UI. The `MediaCardType` type is a simplified version of the media types. The `isMediaCardType` function checks if a given type is a media card type. The `mediaCardTypeToKeys` function returns the media card keys for a given media type. The `keyToMediaCardType` function returns the media card type for a given media key.

The `MaskOptions` interface specifies the options for displaying masks, including the mask keys and whether to show the image.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- As a code documentation expert, I cannot answer this question based on the given code alone. More information about the project is needed.

2. What are the different types of media that can be handled by this code?
- The code defines several types of media, including images, audio, videos, tables, HTML, plotly, object3D, bokeh, and molecules.

3. What is the purpose of the `ManyMasks` and `ManyBoxes` interfaces?
- These interfaces define objects that contain multiple masks or bounding boxes, with each mask or bounding box identified by a unique key.
