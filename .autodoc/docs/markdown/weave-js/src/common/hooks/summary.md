The `useLifecycleProfiling.ts` module provides a custom React hook called `useLifecycleProfiling` that helps developers track the duration a component is mounted in a React application. This can be useful for identifying performance issues and monitoring the performance of different components.

The `useLifecycleProfiling` function takes two parameters:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the component.
- `cb`: A callback function that handles the data collected by the function.

The function utilizes the `useEffect` hook from the React library to track the duration that the component is mounted. When the component is mounted, a timestamp `x` is set, and when the component is unmounted, another timestamp `y` is set. The difference between `x` and `y` represents the duration the component was mounted.

The callback function `cb` is called with an object containing the following properties:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the component.
- `start`: The `x` timestamp when the component is mounted.
- `stop`: The `y` timestamp when the component is unmounted.
- `duration`: The duration the component was mounted, calculated by subtracting `x` from `y` and rounding up to the nearest integer.

Developers can use this function to log the performance of different components and identify which components are causing performance issues. The `cb` function can be customized to send the data to a server for further analysis or to display the data in a dashboard for monitoring purposes.

Here's an example of how to use the `useLifecycleProfiling` function in a React component:

```jsx
import { useLifecycleProfiling } from 'weave';

function MyComponent() {
  useLifecycleProfiling('my-component', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

In this example, the `useLifecycleProfiling` function is called with the `id` of the component set to `'my-component'` and a callback function that logs the data to the console. When the component is mounted and unmounted, the `cb` function is called with the data collected by the function.
