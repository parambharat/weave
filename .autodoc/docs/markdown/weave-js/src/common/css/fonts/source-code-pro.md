This code defines the font styles for the Source Code Pro font family in various weights and styles. The font family is defined as 'Source Code Pro' and each font-face rule specifies a different weight and style combination. 

The purpose of this code is to ensure that the Source Code Pro font family is available and properly styled for use in the larger project. By defining the font styles in this way, the project can easily reference the font family and apply the appropriate weight and style to text elements as needed.

For example, if the project has a code editor component, it may use the Source Code Pro font family to display code snippets. The component can reference the font family and apply the appropriate weight and style to the code text based on the user's preferences or the default styling defined in the project.

Here is an example of how the font family and weight can be applied to a text element in CSS:

```
.code-snippet {
  font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

This would apply the regular weight of the Source Code Pro font family to the text in an element with the class 'code-snippet'.
