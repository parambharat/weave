This file contains several interfaces that define the controls used in the media panel of the larger project. The media panel is responsible for rendering child cards that display various types of media, such as images or videos. The controls defined in this file are used to connect information controlled in the media panel to information used for rendering in the child cards.

The `Style` interface defines the line style used for bounding boxes. The `BoundingBoxSliderControl` interface defines the properties of a slider control used to adjust the confidence threshold for bounding boxes. The `BoundingBoxClassControl` interface defines the properties of a toggle control used to enable or disable a bounding box class. The `AllBoundingBoxControls` interface defines all the bounding box controls, including sliders, toggles, and styles.

The `MaskControl` interface defines the properties of a toggle control used to enable or disable a segmentation mask. The `AllMaskControls` interface defines all the mask controls, including toggles and opacity.

The `Camera3DControl` interface defines the properties of a 3D camera control used to adjust the camera view in the child cards. The `MediaPanelCardControl` interface defines all the controls used in the media panel, including camera, bounding box, and mask controls.

Overall, this file provides a way to define and organize the controls used in the media panel of the larger project. By defining these interfaces, the code can be more easily maintained and extended as new types of media and controls are added. Here is an example of how the `AllBoundingBoxControls` interface might be used:

```
const boundingBoxControls: AllBoundingBoxControls = {
  sliders: {
    confidence: {
      disabled: false,
      comparator: CompareOp.GREATER_THAN,
      value: 0.5
    }
  },
  toggles: {
    boxes: {
      group1: {
        class1: {
          disabled: false
        },
        class2: {
          disabled: true
        },
        all: {
          disabled: false
        }
      },
      group2: {
        class1: {
          disabled: true
        },
        class2: {
          disabled: false
        },
        all: {
          disabled: false
        }
      }
    }
  },
  styles: {
    media1: {
      box1: {
        lineStyle: 'dotted'
      },
      box2: {
        lineStyle: 'dashed'
      }
    },
    media2: {
      box1: {
        lineStyle: 'line'
      },
      box2: {
        lineStyle: 'dotted'
      }
    }
  }
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CompareOp` import from `../util/ops`?
- A smart developer might wonder what `CompareOp` is used for and how it is implemented. Unfortunately, the code provided does not give any indication of its usage or implementation.

2. What is the relationship between `BoundingBoxSliderControl`, `BoundingBoxClassControl`, and `AllBoundingBoxControls`?
- A smart developer might want to understand how these interfaces are related and how they are used in the code. It would be helpful to have some context or examples of how they are implemented.

3. What is the purpose of the `MediaPanelCardControl` interface and how is it used in the project?
- A smart developer might want to know how `MediaPanelCardControl` is used in the project and what its purpose is. It would be helpful to have some context or examples of how it is implemented and used.
