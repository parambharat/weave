This code defines a set of styled components that are used in a larger project called "weave". The components are used to create a file table with search functionality. 

The `FileTableBody` component is a styled `Table.Body` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library. It adds border radius to the top of the table to give it a rounded appearance.

The `SearchRow` component is a styled `tr` element that is used to display the search bar. It sets the cursor to "unset" to prevent it from changing when hovering over the row, and sets the background color to white. When the row is hovered over, the background color remains white. The `td` element within the row has a padding of 0 and overflow set to "hidden" to prevent any content from overflowing. It also has border radius applied to the top left and right corners to match the `FileTableBody` component.

The `NoResultsRow` component is a styled `tr` element that is used to display a message when no search results are found. It has a fixed height of 51 pixels.

The `NoResultsMessage` component is a styled `div` element that is used to display the message when no search results are found. It has a fixed height of 51 pixels and a white background color. It also has a top border of 1 pixel in a light gray color and text color set to a semi-transparent black. The text is centered within the div.

The `SearchInputContainer` component is a styled `span` element that contains the search input field. It has a width of 100% and a white background color. It also has a padding of 13 pixels to give some space around the input field. The `input` element within the container has no border or outline and a transparent background color. It has a padding of 0 on the left side and 32 pixels on the right side to give space for the search icon. The `flex` property is used to allow the input field to grow and shrink as needed.

The `SearchInputIcon` component is a styled `WBIcon` component from the `@wandb/ui` library. It is used to display the search icon within the search input field. It has a gray color and a width of 24 pixels. It is positioned absolutely within the container and has a font size of 28 pixels.

Overall, these styled components are used to create a file table with search functionality in the larger "weave" project. The `SearchRow` component contains the search input field and the `NoResultsMessage` component is displayed when no search results are found. The other components are used to style the table and search input field. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import { FileTableBody, SearchRow, NoResultsRow, NoResultsMessage, SearchInputContainer, SearchInputIcon } from 'weave';

function FileTable() {
  return (
    <Table>
      <FileTableBody>
        <SearchRow>
          <td>
            <SearchInputContainer>
              <SearchInputIcon name="search" />
              <input type="text" placeholder="Search files..." />
            </SearchInputContainer>
          </td>
        </SearchRow>
        <NoResultsRow>
          <td>
            <NoResultsMessage>No results found.</NoResultsMessage>
          </td>
        </NoResultsRow>
      </FileTableBody>
    </Table>
  );
}
```
