This code defines a set of styled components that are used to create a dropdown menu with an input field and a list of options. The dropdown menu is used in the larger project to allow users to select from a list of options.

The `import` statements at the beginning of the file bring in the necessary dependencies, including the `styled-components` library and a custom `AutoCompletingInput` component.

The `CaretWrapper`, `TypeableWrapper`, and `BasicWrapper` components define the different states of the dropdown menu. `CaretWrapper` is used to display a caret icon that indicates that the dropdown menu can be expanded. `TypeableWrapper` is used to display the input field and the list of options when the dropdown menu is expanded. `BasicWrapper` is used to display the selected option when the dropdown menu is collapsed.

The `DisplayedValue` component is used to display the selected option in the `BasicWrapper` component. The `StyledAutoCompletingInput` component is a styled version of the `AutoCompletingInput` component that is used in the `TypeableWrapper` component.

The `DropdownArrow` component is used to display a small arrow icon next to the input field in the `TypeableWrapper` component.

Overall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components that can be used to create a dropdown menu with an input field and a list of options. The components can be customized and combined in different ways to create different types of dropdown menus. For example, the `TypeableWrapper` component could be used on its own to create an autocomplete input field without the dropdown menu.
