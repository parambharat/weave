The `WBAnchoredPopup` module is a React component that renders a popup anchored to a specified element. The popup can be positioned in any of the four directions (top, bottom, left, right) relative to the anchor element. The component is composed of a `WBPopup` component and a `PointyTriangle` component that renders a triangle pointing towards the anchor element.

The `WBAnchoredPopup` component takes several props, including `className`, `direction`, `triangleColor`, `triangleSize`, `anchorElement`, `maxHeight`, `children`, `onParentScroll`, `scrollerRef`, and `onScroll`. The `anchorElement` prop is required and specifies the element to which the popup is anchored. The `direction` prop specifies the direction of the popup relative to the anchor element. The `triangleColor` and `triangleSize` props specify the color and size of the triangle pointing towards the anchor element. The `maxHeight` prop specifies the maximum height of the popup. The `onParentScroll` prop specifies how the popup should behave when the parent element is scrolled. The `scrollerRef` prop is a reference to the scrollable element that contains the popup. The `onScroll` prop is a callback function that is called when the popup is scrolled.

The `WBAnchoredPopup` component uses the `getScrollParent` function to determine the scrollable parent element of the anchor element. It then listens for scroll events on the parent element and updates the position of the popup accordingly. The component also uses the `IntersectionObserver` API to observe changes to the position of the anchor element and update the position of the popup accordingly.

The `WBAnchoredPopup` component renders the `WBPopup` and `PointyTriangle` components inside a `Wrapper` component. The `WBPopup` component is responsible for rendering the actual popup content, while the `PointyTriangle` component renders the triangle pointing towards the anchor element. The `WBPopup` component takes several props, including `className`, `ref`, `scrollerRef`, `x`, `y`, `maxHeight`, `direction`, `noPortal`, and `onScroll`. The `ref` prop is a reference to the `WBPopup` component. The `scrollerRef` prop is a reference to the scrollable element that contains the popup. The `x` and `y` props specify the position of the popup relative to the anchor element. The `maxHeight` prop specifies the maximum height of the popup. The `direction` prop specifies the direction of the popup relative to the anchor element. The `noPortal` prop specifies whether the popup should be rendered inside a portal. The `onScroll` prop is a callback function that is called when the popup is scrolled.

The `PointyTriangle` component takes several props, including `x`, `y`, `size`, `direction`, `color`, and `noPortal`. The `x` and `y` props specify the position of the triangle relative to the anchor element. The `size` prop specifies the size of the triangle. The `direction` prop specifies the direction of the triangle relative to the anchor element. The `color` prop specifies the color of the triangle. The `noPortal` prop specifies whether the triangle should be rendered inside a portal.

Here is an example of how to use the `WBAnchoredPopup` component:

```jsx
import { WBAnchoredPopup } from 'weave';

function MyComponent() {
  const [anchorElement, setAnchorElement] = React.useState(null);

  return (
    <>
      <button ref={setAnchorElement}>Click me</button>
      {anchorElement && (
        <WBAnchoredPopup anchorElement={anchorElement}>
          <div>Popup content</div>
        </WBAnchoredPopup>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WBAnchoredPopup` component?
- The `WBAnchoredPopup` component is used to render a popup anchored to a specified element, with customizable positioning and styling options.

2. What is the role of the `getScrollParent` function?
- The `getScrollParent` function is used to find the nearest scrollable ancestor of a given element, which is used to determine whether the popup should follow the scrolling of its parent element.

3. What is the purpose of the `scrollerRef` prop?
- The `scrollerRef` prop is used to pass a ref to the scrollable element that should be disabled when the `onParentScroll` prop is set to `'disable'`.
