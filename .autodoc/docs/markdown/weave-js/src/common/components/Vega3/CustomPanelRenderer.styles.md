This code defines two styled components, `Wrapper` and `ToggleBindingsButton`, which are used to render a Vega visualization and a button to toggle the display of Vega bindings, respectively. 

The `Wrapper` component is a `div` that wraps the Vega visualization. It has a `showBindings` prop that determines whether the Vega bindings panel is displayed or not. The Vega visualization is rendered using the `vega-embed` library, and the `Wrapper` component styles the `canvas` element to be a block element. The `Wrapper` component also defines styles for the Vega bindings panel, which is an absolute-positioned `div` that appears at the top of the visualization. The panel contains input elements for controlling the Vega visualization, such as sliders, radio buttons, and select boxes. The styles for these input elements are defined using CSS classes that start with `.vega-bind`. The `Wrapper` component also defines styles for an error panel that appears at the top of the visualization when there is an error in the Vega specification.

The `ToggleBindingsButton` component is a button that toggles the display of the Vega bindings panel. It is a `WBIcon` component from the `@wandb/ui` library that is styled using `styled-components`. The button is positioned absolutely at the top right corner of the visualization, and has a circular shape with a gray background. When the button is hovered over, the color of the icon and the background change to the WandB link blue color.

These components are used in the larger project to display Vega visualizations and allow users to interact with them using the Vega bindings panel. The `Wrapper` component is used to wrap the Vega visualization and provide styles for the Vega bindings panel and error panel. The `ToggleBindingsButton` component is used to toggle the display of the Vega bindings panel. Here is an example of how these components might be used:

```
import {Wrapper, ToggleBindingsButton} from 'weave';

const MyVegaVisualization = () => {
  const [showBindings, setShowBindings] = useState(false);

  const handleToggleBindings = () => {
    setShowBindings(!showBindings);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Wrapper showBindings={showBindings}>
        {/* Vega visualization goes here */}
      </Wrapper>
      <ToggleBindingsButton onClick={handleToggleBindings} />
    </>
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Wrapper` component and what props does it accept?
- The `Wrapper` component is used to wrap a Vega visualization and it accepts an optional `showBindings` prop.
2. What is the purpose of the `ToggleBindingsButton` component?
- The `ToggleBindingsButton` component is a styled icon button that toggles the display of the Vega bindings panel.
3. What is the purpose of the `vega-bindings` class and what styling is applied to its child elements?
- The `vega-bindings` class is used to style the Vega bindings panel and its child elements are styled to control the appearance of input elements such as range sliders, radio buttons, and select dropdowns.
