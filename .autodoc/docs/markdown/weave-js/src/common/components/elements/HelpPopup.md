The `HelpPopup` component is a React functional component that renders a help icon with a popup containing help text. The component takes two props: `helpText` which is the text to be displayed in the popup, and `docUrl` which is an optional URL to a documentation page. 

The component uses the `Icon` and `Popup` components from the `semantic-ui-react` library to render the help icon and the popup respectively. The `TargetBlank` component from the `util/links` module is used to render the `docUrl` prop as a hyperlink that opens in a new tab.

The `popup` variable is assigned the `Popup` component with the `inverted`, `size`, `className`, `trigger`, and `content` props set. The `inverted` prop sets the popup to have a dark background with light text, while the `size` prop sets the size of the popup to "mini". The `className` prop sets the class name of the popup content to "help-popup-content". The `trigger` prop sets the help icon as the trigger for the popup, while the `content` prop sets the `helpText` prop as the content of the popup.

The `returnVal` variable is assigned a ternary expression that checks if the `docUrl` prop is not null. If it is not null, the `TargetBlank` component is used to wrap the `popup` variable, passing the `docUrl` prop as the `href` prop. If it is null, the `popup` variable is returned as is.

Finally, the component returns a `span` element with the class name "help-popup" and the `returnVal` variable as its child.

This component can be used in the larger project to provide help text and documentation links for various UI elements. For example, a button component could use this `HelpPopup` component to display a help icon with a popup containing information on what the button does, as well as a link to the documentation page for the button. 

Example usage:

```
<HelpPopup helpText="Click this button to submit the form" docUrl="https://example.com/docs/form-submit" />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code imports two components from the `semantic-ui-react` library and one component from a custom `links` module.

3. What is the expected behavior if `docUrl` is not provided as a prop?
   
   If `docUrl` is not provided, the component will render the help icon with a popup containing only the `helpText` prop.
