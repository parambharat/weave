The code above defines a React component called `TextInput` that renders an input field with a label and an optional sublabel. The component takes in several props, including `dataTest`, `label`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, `sublabel`, and `value`. 

If the `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook returns `true`, the component renders a different component called `TextInputNew` instead of the default input field. This is likely a customization for a specific use case within the larger project.

Otherwise, the component renders a label with the `label` and `sublabel` props, and an input field with the `placeholder`, `value`, and `onChange` props. 

This component can be used throughout the larger project wherever a text input field is needed. Developers can customize the label and sublabel text, as well as the placeholder and initial value of the input field. The `onChange` prop allows developers to specify a function to be called whenever the input value changes. 

Here is an example of how the `TextInput` component can be used in a parent component:

```
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import {TextInput} from './weave/TextInput';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleInputChange = (e, {value}) => {
    setInputValue(value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <TextInput
        dataTest="my-input"
        label="Enter your name:"
        sublabel="(optional)"
        placeholder="John Doe"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={handleInputChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `ParentComponent` renders a `TextInput` component with a label, sublabel, placeholder, and initial value. It also passes in a function called `handleInputChange` to the `onChange` prop, which updates the state of the `inputValue` variable whenever the input value changes.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook and how is it used in this code?
   - The `useWeaveDashUiEnable` hook is used to determine whether the Weave Dash UI is enabled or not. It is used to conditionally render the `TextInputNew` component if the UI is enabled.
2. What is the difference between the `TextInput` component and the `TextInputNew` component?
   - The code does not provide enough information to answer this question. It would require examining the implementation of the `TextInputNew` component to determine its differences from `TextInput`.
3. What is the purpose of the `FC` type in the import statement for React?
   - The `FC` type is a shorthand for the `FunctionComponent` type, which is a type definition for a React functional component. It is used to define the type of the `TextInput` component.
