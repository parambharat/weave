The code defines two React components, `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink`, which are styled Semantic UI buttons with additional custom styles. The `WBButton` component is a regular button, while `WBButtonLink` is a button that is also a link. Both components accept two optional props: `variant` and `size`. `variant` can be one of three values: `ghost`, `confirm`, or `plain`. `size` can be one of three values: `icon`, `small`, or `medium`. 

The `buttonStyles` constant defines the custom styles for the buttons. It uses the `css` function from the `styled-components` library to conditionally apply styles based on the `variant` and `size` props. For example, if `variant` is `ghost`, the button will have transparent background and text color that changes to teal on hover. If `size` is `icon`, the button will have smaller padding.

The `ButtonStyled` and `ButtonLinkStyled` constants are styled Semantic UI `Button` and `Link` components, respectively, with the custom styles from `buttonStyles` applied. The `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components are defined as memoized functional components that render `ButtonStyled` and `ButtonLinkStyled`, respectively, with all props passed through. 

This code can be used in the larger project to create consistent, customizable buttons and button links that match the project's design system. For example, a developer could use `WBButton` to create a "Save" button with the `confirm` variant and `medium` size:

```
<WBButton variant="confirm" size="medium">Save</WBButton>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components?
- The `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components are React functional components that render styled `Button` and `Link` components respectively, with additional props for specifying the button variant and size.

2. What are the possible values for the `variant` and `size` props?
- The `variant` prop can have the values `ghost`, `confirm`, or `plain`, while the `size` prop can have the values `icon`, `small`, or `medium`.

3. What is the purpose of the `buttonStyles` constant?
- The `buttonStyles` constant is a styled-component CSS template literal that defines the common styles for the `Button` and `Link` components, including the button variant and size styles based on the props passed to them.
