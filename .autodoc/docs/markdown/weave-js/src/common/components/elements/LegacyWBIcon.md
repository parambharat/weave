The `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `LegacyWBIcon`. This component is a wrapper around the `Icon` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library, with some additional functionality specific to the `weave` project.

The `LegacyWBIcon` component accepts several props, including `name`, `title`, `size`, `rotated`, `link`, `className`, `onClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `style`, and `data-test`. These props are passed down to the `Icon` component, with the exception of `className`, which is used to construct a custom class name that includes the `name` prop.

The `LegacyWBIcon` component also accepts a `ref` prop, which is passed down to the `Ref` component from `semantic-ui-react`. This allows the parent component to access the underlying DOM node of the `Icon` component.

The `LegacyWBIcon` component is memoized using the `memo` function from React, which helps to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed.

Overall, the `LegacyWBIcon` component provides a convenient way to use icons from the `semantic-ui-react` library within the `weave` project, while also adding some custom functionality specific to the project. Here is an example of how the `LegacyWBIcon` component might be used:

```
import { LegacyWBIcon } from 'weave';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <LegacyWBIcon name="user" size="large" />
      <LegacyWBIcon name="settings" size="large" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `LegacyWBIcon` that renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Icon` component with additional props.

2. What is the significance of the `IconSizeProp` type?
- The `IconSizeProp` type defines a set of valid values for the `size` prop of the `LegacyWBIcon` component, which correspond to different sizes of the rendered icon.

3. Why is `LegacyWBIconComp` defined using `React.forwardRef`?
- `LegacyWBIconComp` is defined using `React.forwardRef` so that it can pass a `ref` to the `Icon` component rendered inside it, allowing the parent component to access the `Icon`'s DOM node if needed.
