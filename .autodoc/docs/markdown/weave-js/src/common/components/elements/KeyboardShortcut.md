This code defines a React component called `KeyboardShortcut` that renders a set of keyboard keys as a visual representation of a keyboard shortcut. The component takes in an array of strings representing the keys to be displayed, as well as an optional boolean `lightMode` flag and a `className` string for styling purposes. 

The component is composed of two styled components: `Keys` and `Key`. `Keys` is a container component that displays its children (the `Key` components) in a horizontal row using the `display: inline-flex` CSS property. `Key` is a component that displays a single keyboard key, with a colored background and rounded corners. The `lightMode` flag determines the color scheme of the component, with a lighter color scheme used when `lightMode` is true.

The `KeyboardShortcut` component maps over the `keys` prop and renders a `Key` component for each key in the array. The `Key` component displays the key text and applies the appropriate background color and text color based on the `lightMode` flag.

This component could be used in a larger project to display keyboard shortcuts to users in a visually appealing way. For example, a code editor application could use this component to display the keyboard shortcuts for various commands. The `lightMode` flag could be used to provide a high-contrast color scheme for users with visual impairments. The `className` prop could be used to apply custom styles to the component, allowing for further customization. 

Example usage:

```
import { KeyboardShortcut } from 'weave';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Press <KeyboardShortcut keys={['Ctrl', 'C']} /> to copy</p>
      <p>Press <KeyboardShortcut keys={['Ctrl', 'V']} lightMode /> to paste</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `KeyboardShortcut` that takes in an array of keyboard shortcut keys and renders them in a stylized format.

2. What is the role of the `styled-components` library in this code?
- The `styled-components` library is used to define the styling for the `Keys` and `Key` components.

3. What is the significance of the `memo` function in this code?
- The `memo` function is used to memoize the `KeyboardShortcutComp` component, which can improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
