The `PointyTriangle` component in the `weave` project is a React functional component that renders a pointy triangle using styled-components. The triangle can be positioned in one of four directions: top, bottom, left, or right. The component takes in several props, including the x and y coordinates of the anchor point, the size of the triangle, the direction it should point, and an optional color. 

The `opposite` function is a helper function that takes in a direction and returns the opposite direction. This is used to remove one of the borders of the triangle to create the pointy effect. 

The `PointyTriangleWrapper` is a styled-component that wraps the triangle and sets its position, size, and color based on the props passed in. It also uses the `opposite` function to remove one of the borders of the triangle. 

The `PointyTriangle` component calculates the position of the triangle based on the anchor point and direction passed in. It then renders the `PointyTriangleWrapper` with the calculated position and other props. If the `noPortal` prop is not passed in or is false, the component uses `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render the triangle in the body of the document. 

This component can be used in a larger project to render tooltips or other UI elements that need to be positioned relative to an anchor point. For example, if a user hovers over a button, a tooltip with additional information could be rendered using the `PointyTriangle` component. 

Example usage:

```
import React from 'react';
import PointyTriangle from './PointyTriangle';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <button>Hover me</button>
      <PointyTriangle x={50} y={50} size={10} direction="bottom" />
    </div>
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PointyTriangle` component?
- The `PointyTriangle` component is used to render a pointy triangle shape in a fixed position on the screen, with customizable size, color, and direction.

2. What is the significance of the `noPortal` prop?
- The `noPortal` prop is an optional boolean prop that, when set to `true`, will render the `PointyTriangle` component as a child of its parent component instead of using `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render it as a child of the `document.body`.

3. What is the purpose of the `opposite` function?
- The `opposite` function takes a `PointyTriangleDirection` argument and returns the opposite direction (e.g. if the argument is `'top'`, it returns `'bottom'`). This is used to set the border style of the `PointyTriangleWrapper` component to create the triangle shape.
