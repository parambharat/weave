The `weave` module contains functions for flattening nested objects in an array of objects. The module exports two functions: `flattenNested` and `flattenNestedObjects`. 

`flattenNested` takes an array of objects and returns a new array of objects where all nested objects have been flattened. The function iterates over each object in the input array and creates a new object with all non-nested properties. For each nested property, the function recursively calls itself to flatten the nested object. If the nested property is an array, the function creates a new object for each element in the array and adds the non-nested properties to each object. The function returns an array of all the new objects.

`flattenNestedObjects` takes an object and returns a new object where all nested objects have been flattened. The function iterates over each property in the input object and creates a new object with all non-nested properties. For each nested property, the function recursively calls itself to flatten the nested object. If the nested property is an array, the function ignores it. The function returns a new object with all the non-nested properties and flattened nested properties.

The module also contains two additional functions: `flattenNestedOld` and `flattenNestedObjectsOld`. These functions are similar to `flattenNested` and `flattenNestedObjects`, but they implement an older version of the flattening algorithm. 

Overall, these functions are useful for transforming data with nested objects into a format that is easier to work with. The flattened objects can be used for data visualization, data analysis, or any other application that requires flat data. 

Example usage:

```
import { flattenNested } from 'weave';

const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'New York', state: 'NY' } },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', address: { city: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA' } },
];

const flattenedData = flattenNested(data);

console.log(flattenedData);
// Output:
// [
//   { id: 1, name: 'Alice', address_city: 'New York', address_state: 'NY' },
//   { id: 2, name: 'Bob', address_city: 'San Francisco', address_state: 'CA' },
// ]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- Unfortunately, the code provided does not give any indication of the purpose of the `weave` project. 

2. What is the purpose of the `flattenNested` function?
- The `flattenNested` function takes an array of objects and returns a new array of objects with all nested objects flattened, while preserving nested arrays and basic values. 

3. What is the difference between `flattenNested` and `flattenNestedOld`?
- `flattenNested` and `flattenNestedOld` are both functions that flatten nested objects, but `flattenNestedOld` also implements the old `tableWithFullPathColNames` transform and uses a different key concatenation policy.
