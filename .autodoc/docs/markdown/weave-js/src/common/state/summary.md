The `weave-js/src/common/state` folder contains custom React hooks and utility functions that enhance the functionality and performance of the Weave project. These hooks and functions are designed to work with other components and modules within the project, providing a more efficient and robust user experience.

For example, the `hooks.ts` file contains several custom React hooks, such as `usePrevious`, `useDeepMemo`, `useGatedValue`, and `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced`. These hooks optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders, tracking state changes, and providing additional functionality for scrolling loading. Here's an example of how the `usePrevious` hook can be used:

```javascript
import { usePrevious } from 'weave/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const prevCount = usePrevious(count);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <p>Previous count: {prevCount}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the `graphql` subfolder, the `runFilesQuery.ts` file defines the `File` interface, which standardizes the representation of files within the system. This interface allows for consistent interaction with files across the project, enabling the creation, updating, and deletion of files through functions like the `createFile` example provided in the summary.

The `queryGraph` subfolder contains the `queryResult.ts` file, which provides utility functions for flattening nested objects in an array of objects. These functions are useful for transforming data with nested objects into a format that is easier to work with, such as data visualization, data analysis, or any other application that requires flat data. Here's an example of how the `flattenNested` function can be used:

```javascript
import { flattenNested } from 'weave/queryGraph';

const data = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'New York', state: 'NY' } },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', address: { city: 'San Francisco', state: 'CA' } },
];

const flattenedData = flattenNested(data);

console.log(flattenedData);
// Output:
// [
//   { id: 1, name: 'Alice', address_city: 'New York', address_state: 'NY' },
//   { id: 2, name: 'Bob', address_city: 'San Francisco', address_state: 'CA' },
// ]
```

In summary, the code in the `weave-js/src/common/state` folder and its subfolders plays a vital role in the Weave project by providing custom React hooks and utility functions that enhance the functionality and performance of the application. These hooks and functions can be used in conjunction with other components and modules within the project to create a more efficient and robust user experience.
