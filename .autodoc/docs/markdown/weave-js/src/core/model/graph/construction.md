The `weave` project contains a file that exports various functions for creating constant nodes and variable nodes. These nodes are used to represent values and variables in a data flow graph. The file imports the `lodash` library and several types from other files in the project.

The `constType` function takes a value and a type and returns a constant node with the given value and type. The `constNodeUnsafe` function is an escape hatch that allows the value of a constant node to be set with loose typing. This function is marked as unsafe because it can hide genuine type mistakes. The `constNode` function is similar to `constType`, but it enforces stricter typing and throws an error if the value is undefined. 

The file also exports several functions for creating constant nodes of specific types, such as `constString` and `constNumberList`. These functions use `constNodeUnsafe` to create the constant nodes with the correct type.

The `constFunction` function is used to create a constant node that represents a function. It takes an object of input types and a function body that returns a node of the output type. It creates variable nodes for each input type and passes them to the function body to generate the output node. The resulting constant node has a type of `function` and includes information about the input types and output type.

The `varNode` function creates a variable node with a given type and variable name. The `voidNode` function creates a node of type `void` that is used to represent the absence of a value.

Overall, this file provides a set of functions for creating constant and variable nodes that can be used to build a data flow graph in the `weave` project. These nodes are used to represent values and variables in the graph and to define the relationships between them.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code provides utility functions for creating various types of constant nodes and variable nodes in the `weave` project, which likely involves some sort of data processing or manipulation.

2. What is the `TypeToTSTypeInner` type and how is it used in this code?
- `TypeToTSTypeInner` is a type alias that maps a `Type` to its corresponding TypeScript type. It is used as a generic type parameter in the `constType` and `constNode` functions to ensure that the `val` parameter has the correct type.

3. Why does the `constNodeUnsafe` function exist and what are the risks of using it?
- `constNodeUnsafe` is used as a fallback when TypeScript cannot infer the type of the `val` parameter in `constNode`. However, using it can be risky because it allows for loose typing and can hide genuine type mistakes.
