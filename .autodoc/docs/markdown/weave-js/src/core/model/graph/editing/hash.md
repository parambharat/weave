The `weave` project includes a file that contains code for generating unique hash values for various types of nodes and operations. The purpose of this code is to provide a way to identify nodes and operations in a way that is stable and consistent across different executions of the program. This is important because the same node or operation may be represented in different ways in different parts of the program, and we want to be able to identify them as the same entity.

The `cyrb53` function is a hash function that takes a string and an optional seed value and returns a 64-bit hash value. This function is used by the `hash` function, which takes a string and returns a string representation of its hash value. The `hash` function is used throughout the code to generate unique identifiers for nodes and operations.

The `Hasher` interface defines three methods for generating hash values for different types of nodes and operations: `typedNodeId`, `nodeId`, and `opId`. The `MemoizedHasher` class implements this interface and provides memoized versions of these methods using the `_.memoize` function from the `lodash` library. Memoization is used to cache the results of previous calls to these methods so that they can be returned quickly if called again with the same arguments.

The `_typedNodeId` method generates a hash value for a node that includes its type information. This is important because nodes with different types should be considered different entities even if they have the same value. The `_nodeId` method generates a hash value for a node that does not include its type information. This is used when we want to identify nodes that have the same value but different types as the same entity. The `_opId` method generates a hash value for an operation that includes the names and input values of the operation.

The `MemoizedHasher` class also provides a `clear` method that can be used to clear the cache of memoized results. This is useful if we want to regenerate hash values for nodes and operations that have changed.

Overall, this code provides a way to generate unique and stable identifiers for nodes and operations in the `weave` project. These identifiers can be used to track the flow of data through the program and to identify nodes and operations that are equivalent but represented differently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `cyrb53` function?
- The `cyrb53` function is a hash function that takes a string and an optional seed value, and returns a 64-bit hash value.

2. What is the difference between `typedNodeId` and `nodeId` in the `Hasher` interface?
- `typedNodeId` produces a stable ID for a node that includes type information, while `nodeId` produces a stable ID for a node that does not include type information.

3. Why is the `MemoizedHasher` class memoizing its methods?
- The `MemoizedHasher` class is memoizing its methods to improve performance by caching the results of expensive computations.
