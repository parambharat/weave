The `weave` project includes a file that exports a function called `graphNorm` and an interface called `NormGraph`. The purpose of this code is to normalize a graph of editing nodes and create a `NormGraph` object that maps each node and operation to a unique ID. This can be useful for comparing two graphs to see if they are equivalent, or for optimizing the graph by identifying redundant nodes.

The `graphNorm` function takes an `EditingNode` object as its input and returns a `NormGraph` object. The `EditingNode` type is defined in another file and includes four possible node types: `const`, `var`, `output`, and `void`. Each node type has a corresponding map in the `NormGraph` object that maps the node to a unique ID.

The `graphNorm` function first initializes an empty `NormGraph` object with empty maps for each node type. It then calls the `visitNode` function with the input node and the `NormGraph` object. The `visitNode` function recursively visits each node in the graph and assigns it a unique ID based on its type. If the node is a constant, variable, or void node, it is added to the corresponding map in the `NormGraph` object. If the node is an output node, it is added to the outputNodes map and the `visitOp` function is called to visit the operation that the output node is connected to. The `visitOp` function assigns a unique ID to the operation and recursively visits its input nodes.

The `visitNode` and `visitOp` functions use the `globalId` variable to assign a unique ID to each node and operation. This variable is incremented each time a new ID is assigned.

Overall, this code provides a way to normalize a graph of editing nodes and create a `NormGraph` object that can be used for comparison or optimization. Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger `weave` project:

```typescript
import { graphNorm, NormGraph } from 'weave';

// create an example editing node graph
const node1 = { nodeType: 'const', value: 5 };
const node2 = { nodeType: 'var', name: 'x' };
const node3 = { nodeType: 'output', fromOp: { opType: 'add', inputs: { a: node1, b: node2 } } };
const node4 = { nodeType: 'void' };

// normalize the graph and get the NormGraph object
const normGraph: NormGraph = graphNorm(node3);

// print the IDs of each node and operation
console.log(normGraph.constNodes.get(node1)); // 0
console.log(normGraph.varNodes.get(node2)); // 1
console.log(normGraph.outputNodes.get(node3)); // 2
console.log(normGraph.ops.get(node3.fromOp)); // 3
console.log(normGraph.voidNodes.get(node4)); // undefined (not in graph)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `NormGraph` interface and how is it used in the code?
- The `NormGraph` interface defines a data structure that maps different types of nodes to unique numerical IDs. It is used to keep track of nodes and their IDs during the normalization process in the `graphNorm` function.

2. What is the significance of the `globalId` variable and how is it used in the code?
- The `globalId` variable is used to assign unique numerical IDs to nodes as they are visited during the normalization process. It is incremented each time a new ID is needed.

3. Why does the `visitNode` function throw an error with the message "graphNorm: unknown node type"?
- The `visitNode` function is designed to handle four different types of nodes: const, var, output, and void. If a node with an unknown type is encountered, it is not clear how to handle it during normalization, so an error is thrown to alert the developer to this issue.
