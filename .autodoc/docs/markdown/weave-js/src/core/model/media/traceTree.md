This file defines several types that are used in the larger weave project. The `StatusCodeType` is a union type that can only be one of two string literals: 'SUCCESS' or 'ERROR'. The `SpanKindType` is also a union type that can only be one of four string literals: 'LLM', 'CHAIN', 'AGENT', or 'TOOL'. 

The `ResultType` type is an object that has two optional properties: `inputs` and `outputs`. Both properties are objects with string keys and any values. 

The `SpanType` type is an object that represents a span in a trace. It has several optional properties: `span_id`, `name`, `start_time_ms`, `end_time_ms`, `status_code`, `status_message`, `attributes`, `results`, `child_spans`, and `span_kind`. The `span_id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the span. The `name` property is a string that describes the span. The `start_time_ms` and `end_time_ms` properties are numbers that represent the start and end times of the span in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. The `status_code` property is a `StatusCodeType` that represents the status of the span. The `status_message` property is a string that provides additional information about the status. The `attributes` property is an object with string keys and any values that represent metadata associated with the span. The `results` property is an array of `ResultType` objects that represent the inputs and outputs of the span. The `child_spans` property is an array of `SpanType` objects that represent the child spans of the span. The `span_kind` property is a `SpanKindType` that represents the kind of span. 

The `WBTraceTree` type is an object that represents a trace tree. It has two properties: `_type` and `root_span_dumps`. The `_type` property is a string that identifies the type of the object as 'wb_trace_tree'. The `root_span_dumps` property is a string that represents the root span of the trace tree as a serialized `SpanType` object. The `model_hash` and `model_dict_dumps` properties are optional and represent additional information about the trace tree. 

This file is used in the larger weave project to define the types that are used to represent spans and trace trees. These types are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and type safety. For example, a function that creates a new span might take a `SpanType` object as an argument and return a new `SpanType` object. 

Example usage:

```
import { SpanType } from 'weave';

function createSpan(name: string): SpanType {
  const span: SpanType = {
    name,
    start_time_ms: Date.now(),
    child_spans: [],
    span_kind: 'AGENT'
  };
  // do some work
  span.end_time_ms = Date.now();
  span.status_code = 'SUCCESS';
  return span;
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code defines types for `SpanType` and `WBTraceTree` used in the `weave` project, but further information is needed to understand the overall purpose of the project.

2. What are the possible values for `StatusCodeType` and `SpanKindType`?
- `StatusCodeType` can have the values `'SUCCESS'` or `'ERROR'`, while `SpanKindType` can have the values `'LLM'`, `'CHAIN'`, `'AGENT'`, or `'TOOL'`.

3. What is the structure of the `WBTraceTree` type and what is the purpose of its properties?
- `WBTraceTree` is an object with a `_type` property set to `'wb_trace_tree'`, a `root_span_dumps` property of type `string` representing a `SpanType`, and optional `model_hash` and `model_dict_dumps` properties. Further information is needed to understand the purpose of these properties and the overall use of `WBTraceTree` in the `weave` project.
