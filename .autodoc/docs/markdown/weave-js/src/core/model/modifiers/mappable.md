The `weave` project includes a module that provides functions for mapping and transforming data types. The module exports several functions that can be used to apply a given function to a data type, either synchronously or asynchronously.

The `mappable` function takes two arguments: a `type` and an `applyFn` function. The `type` argument is a data type defined in the `Types` module, and the `applyFn` argument is a function that takes a `Types.Type` argument and returns a `Types.Type`. The `mappable` function checks if the `type` argument is a list type, and if so, applies the `applyFn` function to the list object type. The resulting list type includes the transformed object type, as well as the minimum and maximum length of the list. If the `type` argument is not a list type, the `applyFn` function is simply applied to the `type` argument. The `mappable` function returns the transformed data type.

The `mappableAsync` function is similar to `mappable`, but it is asynchronous and takes an additional `Promise` wrapper. The `applyFn` function in `mappableAsync` must return a `Promise` that resolves to a `Types.Type` object.

The `mappableStrip` function takes a `type` argument and returns the object type of a list type. If the `type` argument is not a list type, the function simply returns the `type` argument.

The `mappableVal` function takes two arguments: a value `v` and an `applyFn` function. If the `v` argument is an array, the `applyFn` function is applied to each element of the array, and the resulting array is returned. If the `v` argument is not an array, the `applyFn` function is simply applied to the `v` argument.

The `mappableValAsync` function is similar to `mappableVal`, but it is asynchronous and takes an additional `Promise` wrapper. The `applyFn` function in `mappableValAsync` must return a `Promise` that resolves to a value.

These functions can be used to transform and map data types in the `weave` project. For example, the `mappable` function could be used to transform a list of objects by applying a given function to each object in the list. The `mappableVal` function could be used to transform a single value by applying a given function to the value. The asynchronous versions of these functions could be used when the transformation function is asynchronous.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `mappable` function?
- The `mappable` function takes in a `type` and an `applyFn` function, and returns a `Types.Type`. It applies the `applyFn` function to the `type`, and if the `type` is a list, it also applies the `applyFn` function to the list object type.

2. What is the difference between `mappable` and `mappableAsync`?
- The `mappable` function is synchronous, while the `mappableAsync` function is asynchronous and returns a promise. The `mappableAsync` function also takes an asynchronous `applyFn` function that returns a promise of a `Types.Type`.

3. What is the purpose of the `mappableVal` function?
- The `mappableVal` function takes in a value `v` and an `applyFn` function, and returns a value. If the value is an array, it maps over the array and applies the `applyFn` function to each element. Otherwise, it applies the `applyFn` function to the value.
