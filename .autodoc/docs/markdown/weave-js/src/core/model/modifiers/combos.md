This code file provides a set of utility functions to manipulate and apply transformations to types and values in the larger Weave project. The functions are designed to handle nullable, taggable, and mappable types and values, as well as combinations of these.

The main functions provided are:

- `nullableTaggable`, `nullableTaggableAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a nullable and taggable type.
- `nullableTaggableStrip`: Strip nullable and taggable wrappers from a type.
- `nullableTaggableVal`, `nullableTaggableValAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a nullable and taggable value.
- `mappableNullable`, `mappableNullableVal`, `mappableNullableValAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a mappable and nullable type or value.
- `mappableTaggable`, `mappableTaggableVal`, `mappableTaggableValAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a mappable and taggable type or value.
- `mappableNullableTaggable`, `mappableNullableTaggableAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a mappable, nullable, and taggable type.
- `mappableNullableTaggableVal`, `mappableNullableTaggableValAsync`: Apply a transformation function to a mappable, nullable, and taggable value.

Additionally, the code provides `mntTypeApply`, `mntTypeApplyAsync`, `mntTypeStrip`, `mntValueApply`, and `mntValueApplyAsync` functions, which apply a transformation function to types and values with more complex configurations, such as preserving or removing tags and handling 'none' types.

For example, to apply a transformation function `fn` to a nullable and taggable type `type`, you can use:

```javascript
const transformedType = nullableTaggable(type, fn);
```

These utility functions can be used throughout the Weave project to manipulate and transform types and values as needed, making it easier to work with complex data structures and apply custom logic.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `mntTypeApply` function and how does it work?**

   The `mntTypeApply` function is used to apply a given function `fn` to a given `type` with specific rules defined by the `TypeProcessingConfig`. It processes the type by mapping it down to a specified number of dimensions, maintaining or removing tags, and passing or skipping the 'none' type. It also handles unions by applying the function to each member of the union.

2. **How does the `mntValueApply` function differ from the `mntTypeApply` function?**

   The `mntValueApply` function is similar to the `mntTypeApply` function, but it operates on values instead of types. It applies a given function `fn` to a given `value` with specific rules defined by the `TypeProcessingConfig`. The function processes the value by mapping it down to a specified number of dimensions, maintaining or removing tags, and passing or skipping the 'none' value.

3. **What is the role of the `TypeProcessingConfig` in this code?**

   The `TypeProcessingConfig` is an optional configuration object that can be passed to the `mntTypeApply`, `mntTypeApplyAsync`, `mntTypeStrip`, `mntValueApply`, and `mntValueApplyAsync` functions. It defines the rules for processing types and values, such as the number of dimensions to map down to (`dims`), whether to maintain or remove tags (`tags`), and whether to pass or skip the 'none' type or value (`nones`).
