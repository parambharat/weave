This file contains several constants that are used throughout the larger project. The `MAX_RUN_LIMIT` constant is set to 50 and is likely used to limit the number of times a particular function or process can run. The `MAX_DATE_MS` constant is set to a very large number and is likely used to represent the maximum possible date value in the project.

The file also includes two boolean constants, `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` and `LOG_DEBUG_MESSAGES`. If `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` is set to true, the file attaches two debugging functions to the global object: `op` and `cgQuery`. The `op` function allows the user to access an operation by name and map positional arguments to the expected input object. The `cgQuery` function is an asynchronous query for a node. These functions are likely used for debugging and testing purposes.

If `LOG_DEBUG_MESSAGES` is set to true, the project will log debug messages. This is also likely used for debugging and testing purposes.

Overall, this file provides important constants and debugging functions that are used throughout the larger project. Here is an example of how the `op` function might be used:

```
const projectName = op('project-name')(op('root-project')('shawn', 'fashion-sweep'));
```

This code would use the `op` function to access the `project-name` operation and pass in the `root-project` operation with the arguments `'shawn'` and `'fashion-sweep'`. The resulting `projectName` variable would contain the result of the `project-name` operation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `MAX_RUN_LIMIT` constant?
- `MAX_RUN_LIMIT` is likely used to set a maximum limit on the number of times a certain process or function can run.

2. Why is the `MAX_DATE_MS` constant set to such a high value?
- `MAX_DATE_MS` is set to the maximum possible date value in JavaScript, likely to ensure that any date comparisons or calculations within the code do not exceed this limit.

3. What is the purpose of the `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` and `LOG_DEBUG_MESSAGES` constants?
- `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` and `LOG_DEBUG_MESSAGES` are likely used to enable or disable debugging functionality within the code. If `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` is set to `true`, additional debugging functions will be attached to the global object. If `LOG_DEBUG_MESSAGES` is set to `true`, debug messages will be logged to the console.
