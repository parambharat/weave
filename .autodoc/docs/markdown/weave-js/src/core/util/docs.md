The `weave` project contains a file that exports two functions: `urlSafeTypeId` and `docType`. The purpose of these functions is to generate URLs and text for documentation pages related to different types of entities in the `weave` project. 

The `urlSafeTypeId` function takes a `typeId` string as input and returns a kebab-cased version of the string. This is necessary because the machine that builds the documentation is case-insensitive, so kebab-casing ensures that the links to the documentation pages are not broken. For example, if `typeId` is "MyType", `urlSafeTypeId` will return "my-type". 

The `docType` function takes a `typeId` string and an optional `options` object as input, and returns a string that represents the type of entity. If the `options` object has a `plural` property set to `true`, the function returns the plural form of the entity type. For example, if `typeId` is "W&B Entity" and `options` is `{plural: true}`, `docType` will return "W&B Entities". 

If the `typeId` is in the `TYPES_WITH_PAGES` array, which contains a list of entity types that have documentation pages, `docType` returns a string that includes a link to the documentation page for that entity type. The link is generated using the `TYPE_DOC_URL` constant and the `urlSafeTypeId` function. For example, if `typeId` is "MyType" and is in `TYPES_WITH_PAGES`, `docType` will return a string that includes a link to the documentation page for "my-type". 

If the `typeId` is not in `TYPES_WITH_PAGES`, `docType` returns a string that emphasizes the fact that it is a type, using underscores to indicate it is a type name. 

Overall, these functions are used to generate consistent and correct links and text for documentation pages related to different types of entities in the `weave` project. They can be used throughout the project to ensure that documentation is accurate and easy to navigate. 

Example usage:

```
import { urlSafeTypeId, docType } from 'weave';

const typeId = 'MyType';
const plural = true;

const urlSafe = urlSafeTypeId(typeId); // returns "my-type"
const typeText = docType(typeId, { plural }); // returns "MyTypes"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `urlSafeTypeId` function?
- The `urlSafeTypeId` function converts a given `typeId` string to kebab-case format to ensure that links to documentation pages are not broken due to case sensitivity.

2. What is the purpose of the `docType` function?
- The `docType` function generates a string representation of a given `typeId` with optional pluralization, and returns a link to the documentation page for the type if it exists in the `TYPES_WITH_PAGES` array.

3. What is the significance of the `TYPE_DOC_URL` constant?
- The `TYPE_DOC_URL` constant stores the URL of the documentation website for the `weave` project, which is used to generate links to documentation pages in the `docType` function.
