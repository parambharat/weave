The code provided consists of two functions, `baseName` and `extension`, which are used to extract the base name and extension of a file path, respectively. 

The `baseName` function takes a string parameter `path` which represents the file path and splits it into an array of strings using the forward slash `/` as the delimiter. It then returns the last element of the array, which represents the base name of the file. 

For example, if the input `path` is `/home/user/documents/file.txt`, the function will return `file.txt`.

The `extension` function also takes a string parameter `path` and uses the `baseName` function to extract the file name. It then splits the file name into an array of strings using the period `.` as the delimiter and returns the last element of the array, which represents the file extension.

For example, if the input `path` is `/home/user/documents/file.txt`, the function will return `txt`.

These functions can be used in a larger project to extract file names and extensions for various purposes such as file manipulation, filtering, or sorting. For instance, if a project requires filtering files based on their extensions, the `extension` function can be used to extract the extension of each file and compare it to a list of accepted extensions. 

Example usage:

```
const filePath = '/home/user/documents/file.txt';
const fileName = baseName(filePath); // returns 'file.txt'
const fileExtension = extension(filePath); // returns 'txt'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `baseName` function?
   - The `baseName` function takes a string `path` and returns the last part of the path after splitting it by `/`, which is essentially the file or directory name.

2. What is the purpose of the `extension` function?
   - The `extension` function takes a string `path` and returns the file extension of the file in the path by first calling the `baseName` function to get the file name and then splitting it by `.` to get the last part, which is the extension.

3. Are there any potential issues with this code?
   - One potential issue with this code is that it assumes that the file path contains a file name with an extension. If the path is a directory path or a file path without an extension, the `extension` function will return an empty string or an incorrect value.
