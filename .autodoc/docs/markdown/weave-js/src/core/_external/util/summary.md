The code in the `urls.ts` file provides utility functions to generate URLs for various resources within the larger project. These functions accept specific parameters and return a URL string that can be used to access the corresponding resource via HTTP requests. For example, the `artifact` function generates a URL for a specific artifact, given its entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, and artifact commit hash.

Here's an example of how the `artifact` function might be used:

```javascript
import { artifact } from './urls';

const url = artifact({
  entityName: 'exampleEntity',
  projectName: 'exampleProject',
  artifactTypeName: 'exampleType',
  artifactSequenceName: 'exampleSequence',
  artifactCommitHash: 'exampleHash',
});

console.log(url); // Output: /exampleEntity/exampleProject/artifacts/exampleType/exampleSequence/exampleHash
```

The `vega3.ts` file defines interfaces for representing GraphQL queries in the project. These interfaces (`QueryArg`, `QueryField`, and `Query`) are used to define and manipulate GraphQL queries throughout the project. For instance, a function that builds a GraphQL query might use these interfaces to construct the query object.

Here's an example of how the `Query` interface might be used to build a GraphQL query:

```javascript
import { Query, QueryField, QueryArg } from './vega3';

function buildQuery(): Query {
  const queryFields: QueryField[] = [
    {
      name: 'user',
      args: [
        { name: 'id', value: 123 },
      ],
      fields: [
        { name: 'name' },
        { name: 'email' },
      ],
    },
  ];

  return { queryFields };
}

const query = buildQuery();
```

In this example, the `buildQuery` function constructs a `Query` object with a single top-level field: a `user` field with an `id` argument and two subfields (`name` and `email`). This query could then be executed against a GraphQL API using a library like Apollo Client.

In summary, the code in the `urls.ts` file provides utility functions for generating URLs for various resources, while the `vega3.ts` file defines interfaces for representing GraphQL queries. These utilities and interfaces are used throughout the project to facilitate the construction and manipulation of URLs and GraphQL queries, making it easier for developers to work with these resources.
