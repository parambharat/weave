This file contains several functions that generate URLs for different resources in the larger project. The `artifact` function generates a URL for a specific artifact in the project, based on the provided parameters. The `artifactCollection` function generates a URL for a collection of artifacts, based on the provided parameters. The `project` function generates a URL for a specific project, based on the provided parameters. The `run` function generates a URL for a specific run of a project, based on the provided parameters. Finally, the `reportView` function generates a URL for a specific report in the project, based on the provided parameters.

Each function takes in an object with specific properties that are used to construct the URL. For example, the `artifact` function takes in an object with properties for the entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, and artifact commit hash. These properties are used to construct a URL in the format `/{entityName}/{projectName}/artifacts/{artifactTypeName}/{artifactSequenceName}/{artifactCommitHash}`.

The `makeNameAndID` function is also included in this file, which is used by the `reportView` function to generate a name and ID for a report. This function takes in an ID and an optional name, and returns a string that combines the two in the format `{encodeURIComponent(name)}--{id}`. The `encodeURIComponent` function is used to ensure that the name is properly encoded for use in a URL.

Overall, these functions are used to generate URLs for different resources in the project, which can be used to access those resources via HTTP requests. For example, the `artifact` function could be used to generate a URL for a specific artifact, which could then be used to download or view that artifact. The `project` function could be used to generate a URL for a specific project, which could then be used to view information about that project. These functions provide a convenient way to generate URLs for different resources in the project, without having to manually construct them each time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code provides functions for generating URLs for various artifacts, runs, and reports within the `weave` project, but it does not provide information on the overall purpose of the project.

2. What are the expected inputs for the functions in this code?
- The functions take in different combinations of entity name, project name, artifact type name, artifact sequence name, artifact commit hash, artifact collection name, run name, report ID, and report name as string inputs.

3. What is the purpose of the `makeNameAndID` function and how is it used?
- The `makeNameAndID` function takes in an ID and an optional name, and returns a string that combines the name and ID in a URL-friendly format. It is used in the `reportView` function to generate a URL for a report with a given ID and name.
