The `weave` project contains a file that defines a cache interface and an abstract class that partially implements the cache interface. The cache interface defines methods for getting, setting, and invalidating cache entries, as well as checking if a key exists in the cache. The interface also includes methods for getting and setting multiple cache entries at once. The cache interface is generic and requires a `CacheKey` type, which is defined as a type alias for a `Node` type from the `GraphTypes` module.

The abstract class, `DependencyAwareCache`, implements some of the methods from the cache interface and provides a default implementation for handling dependencies. The class is intended to be used as a base class for more specific caches. The class requires subclasses to implement methods for converting outer keys to inner keys, deleting keys, setting keys, getting keys, checking if keys exist, and resetting the cache. The class also defines a `cascadeDelete` method that recursively deletes dependent keys when a key is invalidated.

The `DependencyAwareCache` class allows the caller to provide downstream dependents and upstream dependencies. When a key is invalidated, it will invalidate all dependent keys. The class uses a `Map` to store the dependency relationships between keys. The `set` method adds dependencies and dependents to the map when a key is set. The `invalidate` method deletes a key and all its dependent keys from the map.

Here is an example of how the `DependencyAwareCache` class might be used:

```typescript
class MyCache extends DependencyAwareCache<string, string> {
  outerKeyToInnerKey(key: string): string {
    return key;
  }

  async delKey(key: string): Promise<void> {
    // delete key from cache
  }

  setKey(key: string, value: any, ttlSeconds?: number): boolean {
    // set key in cache
    return true;
  }

  getKey(key: string): any {
    // get key from cache
  }

  hasKey(key: string): boolean {
    // check if key exists in cache
    return true;
  }

  async reset(): Promise<void> {
    // reset cache
  }
}

const cache = new MyCache();
cache.set('key1', 'value1', 60, ['key2'], ['key3']);
cache.set('key2', 'value2', 60, ['key3'], ['key1']);
cache.set('key3', 'value3', 60, ['key1'], ['key2']);
cache.invalidate('key1');
```

In this example, a `MyCache` class is defined that extends the `DependencyAwareCache` class. The `outerKeyToInnerKey` method simply returns the key as-is. The `delKey`, `setKey`, `getKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset` methods are implemented to interact with an actual cache. Three keys are set in the cache with dependencies and dependents. When `key1` is invalidated, `key2` and `key3` are also deleted from the cache because they depend on `key1`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code defines an interface and an abstract class for a cache that supports CG execution. It is not clear from this code alone what the overall purpose of the `weave` project is.

2. What is the relationship between `CacheKey`, `MultiSetEntry`, and `GraphTypes.Node`?
- `CacheKey` is a type alias for `GraphTypes.Node`, which is imported from the `../model/graph/types` module. `MultiSetEntry` is an interface that uses `K extends CacheKey` as a generic type parameter, which means that `MultiSetEntry` can be used with any type that extends `CacheKey`, including `GraphTypes.Node`.

3. What is the purpose of the `DependencyAwareCache` class and what methods must be implemented by its subclasses?
- `DependencyAwareCache` is an abstract class that partially implements the `Cache` interface. It provides a default implementation for handling dependencies and requires subclasses to implement several abstract methods, including `outerKeyToInnerKey`, `delKey`, `setKey`, `getKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset`. The key aspect of this class is that it allows the caller to provide downstream dependents and upstream dependencies, and when a key is invalidated, it will invalidate all dependent keys.
