This code exports three modules from the `weave` project: `defaultLanguageBinding`, `js`, and `types`. 

The `defaultLanguageBinding` module is exported from the `default` file. It likely contains the default language binding for the project, which is used to define the syntax and semantics of the language being implemented. This module may be used by other parts of the project to provide a default implementation of the language binding.

The `js` module is exported from the `js` file. It likely contains code related to the JavaScript language, such as a parser or interpreter. This module may be used by other parts of the project to provide support for JavaScript code.

The `types` module is exported from the `types` file. It likely contains type definitions for the project, such as interfaces or classes. This module may be used by other parts of the project to ensure type safety and consistency throughout the codebase.

Overall, this code is a simple way to export commonly used modules from the `weave` project. Other parts of the project can import these modules using the `import` statement, like so:

```javascript
import { defaultLanguageBinding, someType } from 'weave';
```

This allows for easy access to important functionality and types throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `defaultLanguageBinding` export from the `./default` module?
- A smart developer might ask this question to understand the role of the `defaultLanguageBinding` in the `weave` project. 

2. Why is there a `tslint:disable-next-line` comment before the `export * from './js'` statement?
- A smart developer might ask this question to understand why the linter rule for circular imports is being disabled for this particular statement.

3. What types of functionality are being exported from the `./types` module?
- A smart developer might ask this question to understand the specific types that are being exported from the `./types` module and how they are used in the `weave` project.
