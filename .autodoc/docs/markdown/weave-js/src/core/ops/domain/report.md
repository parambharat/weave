The code in this file defines a set of operations related to reports in a larger project. These operations are used to retrieve various pieces of information about a report, such as its name, description, creation time, and view count. 

Each operation is defined using the `makeOp` function, which takes several arguments including the operation name, argument types, description, return type, and resolver function. The argument types are defined using the `reportArgTypes` object, which specifies that each operation takes an optional `report` argument that can be either a single report or an array of reports. The `reportArgDescription` variable provides a description of this argument for use in the operation documentation.

The `makeReportReturnType` function is used to define the return type of each operation based on the input argument type. It takes a `returnType` argument that specifies the type of the operation's return value (e.g. string, date, project), and returns a function that takes an `inputs` argument and returns a `mappableNullableTaggable` object. This object represents the operation's return value and can be mapped over, filtered, and tagged with additional metadata.

The `makeReportResolver` function is used to define the resolver function for each operation. It takes an `applyFn` argument that specifies how to transform the `report` argument into the operation's return value. This function returns another function that takes an `inputs` argument and returns a `mappableNullableTaggableVal` object. This object represents the operation's return value and can be mapped over, filtered, and tagged with additional metadata, but also includes the actual return value.

Finally, each operation is exported as a separate named export. These operations can be used by other parts of the project to retrieve information about reports. For example, the `opReportName` operation can be used to retrieve the name of a report, as shown below:

```
const report = { displayName: 'My Report' };
const inputs = { report };
const result = opReportName.resolver(inputs).value;
console.log(result); // 'My Report'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code provides a set of operations for retrieving information about reports in the `weave` project.
2. What is the format of the input and output for these operations?
- The input is an object with a `report` property that can be either a single report or an array of reports. The output is a mappable, nullable, and taggable value of a specific type (e.g. string, link, date, project, user, or list of users).
3. What is the significance of the `hidden` property in the `makeOp` function?
- The `hidden` property indicates that these operations should not be visible to users of the `weave` project, and are likely intended for internal use only.
