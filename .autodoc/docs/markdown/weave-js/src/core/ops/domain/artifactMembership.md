This code defines a set of operations related to artifact membership. The purpose of these operations is to provide access to various properties of an artifact membership object. 

The `makeStandardOp` function is used to define each operation. This function takes an object with several properties as an argument. The `hidden` property is set to `true` for all operations, which means that they are not intended to be used directly by users of the system. The `name` property specifies the name of the operation. The `argTypes` property specifies the types of arguments that the operation expects. In this case, there is only one argument type, `artifactMembership`. The `returnType` property specifies the type of value that the operation returns. Finally, the `resolver` property specifies the function that is called to compute the result of the operation.

Each operation is named according to the property of the artifact membership object that it provides access to. For example, `opArtifactMembershipId` returns the ID of the artifact membership object, while `opArtifactMembershipArtifactVersion` returns the artifact version associated with the membership.

These operations are likely to be used by other parts of the system that need to access information about artifact memberships. For example, they might be used by a user interface that displays information about artifacts and their associated memberships. 

Here is an example of how one of these operations might be used:

```
const membership = ... // an artifact membership object
const id = opArtifactMembershipId({artifactMembership: membership});
console.log(`Membership ID: ${id}`);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `makeStandardOp` function?
- The `makeStandardOp` function is used to create standard operations with a hidden flag, name, argument types, return type, and resolver function.

2. What is the `artifactMembership` object and where does it come from?
- The `artifactMembership` object is an argument passed to the resolver functions of each operation. It likely comes from some other part of the codebase or external system.

3. What is the purpose of the `opArtifactMembershipLink` operation?
- The `opArtifactMembershipLink` operation returns a link object with a name and URL that points to a specific version of an artifact.
