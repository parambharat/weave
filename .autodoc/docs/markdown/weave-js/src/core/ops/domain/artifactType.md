This code defines a set of operations related to artifact types in the larger project called "weave". The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of interacting with artifact types and their associated artifacts. 

The code imports various modules from within the project, including `list` from the `model` module, `docType` from the `util/docs` module, and `makeStandardOp` from the `opKinds` module. It also imports a utility function called `connectionToNodes` from a local file called `util`.

The code defines four operations related to artifact types: `opArtifactTypeName`, `opArtifactTypeArtifacts`, `opArtifactTypeSequences`, and `opArtifactTypePortfolios`. Each operation is defined using the `makeStandardOp` function, which takes an object with various properties defining the operation. 

The `opArtifactTypeName` operation returns the name of a given artifact type. It takes an argument `artifactType` of type `artifactType` and returns a string. The `opArtifactTypeArtifacts` operation returns a list of artifacts associated with a given artifact type. It also takes an argument `artifactType` of type `artifactType` and returns a list of `artifact` objects. The `opArtifactTypeSequences` and `opArtifactTypePortfolios` operations are hidden and not intended for external use. They return lists of artifacts associated with a given artifact type, but with different filtering criteria.

Finally, the `opArtifactTypeArtifactVersions` operation returns a list of all artifact versions associated with all artifacts of a given artifact type. It takes an argument `artifactType` of type `artifactType` and returns a list of `artifactVersion` objects.

Overall, this code provides a standardized way of interacting with artifact types and their associated artifacts in the larger "weave" project. Developers can use these operations to retrieve information about artifact types and their artifacts, and to perform various operations on them. For example, a developer could use the `opArtifactTypeArtifacts` operation to retrieve a list of artifacts associated with a given artifact type, and then use the `connectionToNodes` utility function to perform further operations on those artifacts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?
- This code is defining operations related to artifact types in the `weave` project, but more information is needed to understand the overall purpose of the project.

2. What is the `makeStandardOp` function and how is it used in this code?
- The `makeStandardOp` function is imported from `../opKinds` and appears to be used to define the operations in this file, but more information is needed to understand its implementation and purpose.

3. What is the `connectionToNodes` function and how does it work?
- The `connectionToNodes` function is imported from `./util` and appears to be used to resolve the operations in this file, but more information is needed to understand its implementation and purpose.
