The `weave` project contains a file that exports two functions: `opAssetArtifactVersion` and `opAssetFile`. These functions are used to retrieve information about assets in the project. 

`opAssetArtifactVersion` is a function that returns the artifact version of an asset. It takes an argument `asset` which is a nullable one or many union of types that include a file tag. The function returns the artifact version of the asset, which is a string. If the artifact version cannot be found, the function returns null. 

`opAssetFile` is a function that returns the file of an asset. It takes an argument `asset` which is a nullable one or many union of basic media types. The function returns the file of the asset, which is an object with a type of "file". The function first retrieves the artifact version of the asset using `opAssetArtifactVersion`, and then uses that information to retrieve the file. 

These functions are used in the larger `weave` project to retrieve information about assets. For example, if a user wants to retrieve the file of an asset, they can call `opAssetFile` and pass in the asset as an argument. The function will return the file of the asset. Similarly, if a user wants to retrieve the artifact version of an asset, they can call `opAssetArtifactVersion` and pass in the asset as an argument. The function will return the artifact version of the asset. 

Overall, these functions provide a way for users to retrieve important information about assets in the `weave` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `opAssetArtifactVersion` function?
- The `opAssetArtifactVersion` function returns the artifact version of an asset.
2. What types of assets does the `opAssetFile` function accept as input?
- The `opAssetFile` function accepts media assets with basic media types as input.
3. What is the purpose of the `mediaAssetArgTypes` constant?
- The `mediaAssetArgTypes` constant defines the argument types for the `opAssetFile` function, specifically the `asset` argument which accepts media assets with basic media types.
