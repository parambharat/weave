This file contains a set of operations that can be performed on an artifact. An artifact is a data object that represents a piece of data in the system. The operations in this file allow users to retrieve information about an artifact, such as its name, description, type, versions, and creation date. 

The `makeArtifactOp` function is used to create a standard operation for an artifact. This function takes an object with various properties such as `name`, `argTypes`, `returnType`, and `resolver`. The `resolver` function is the main function that performs the operation on the artifact. 

For example, `opArtifactName` is an operation that returns the name of an artifact. It takes an `artifact` argument and returns a string. The `resolver` function for this operation simply returns the `name` property of the `artifact` object. 

Similarly, `opArtifactVersions` returns a list of versions for an artifact, and `opArtifactCreatedAt` returns the creation date of an artifact. 

Some operations are marked as `hidden`, which means they are not intended to be used directly by users. These operations are used internally by the system. 

The `opArtifactLink` operation returns a URL for an artifact. It takes an `artifact` argument and returns an object with a `name` and `url` property. The `url` property is generated using the `Urls.artifactCollection` function, which takes various parameters such as the entity name, project name, artifact type name, and artifact collection name. 

Overall, this file provides a set of operations that can be used to retrieve information about an artifact. These operations can be used in other parts of the system to display information about artifacts to users or to perform other operations on artifacts. 

Example usage:

```
const myArtifact = {
  id: '123',
  name: 'myArtifact',
  description: 'This is my artifact',
  defaultArtifactType: {
    name: 'myArtifactType'
  },
  artifacts: [
    {
      version: '1.0.0'
    },
    {
      version: '2.0.0'
    }
  ],
  createdAt: '2022-01-01T00:00:00',
  project: {
    name: 'myProject',
    entity: {
      name: 'myEntity'
    }
  }
};

const artifactName = opArtifactName.resolver({artifact: myArtifact});
// artifactName = 'myArtifact'

const artifactVersions = opArtifactVersions.resolver({artifact: myArtifact});
// artifactVersions = [{version: '1.0.0'}, {version: '2.0.0'}]

const artifactLink = opArtifactLink.resolver({artifact: myArtifact});
// artifactLink = {name: 'myArtifact', url: 'https://myEntity.myProject.myArtifactType/myArtifact'}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- As a code documentation expert, I cannot answer this question based on the given code alone. 

2. What is the `makeStandardOp` function and how is it used in this code?
- `makeStandardOp` is a function that creates a standard operation object with properties such as `name`, `argTypes`, `returnType`, and `resolver`. It is used to create various operations related to artifacts in this code.

3. What is the purpose of the `opArtifactLink` operation?
- The `opArtifactLink` operation returns the URL for a given artifact, including the entity name, project name, artifact type name, and artifact collection name. It is used to generate links to artifacts in the system.
