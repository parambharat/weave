This code defines two operations related to artifact aliases in the larger project called weave. The purpose of these operations is to provide functionality for working with artifact aliases, which are user-defined names for artifacts in the project. 

The first operation, `opArtifactAliasAlias`, returns the alias of a given artifact alias. It takes in an object with an `artifactAlias` property and returns a string representing the alias. The `resolver` function extracts the `alias` property from the `artifactAlias` object and returns it. This operation is marked as `hidden`, which means it is not intended to be used directly by users of the project.

The second operation, `opArtifactAliasArtifact`, returns the artifact collection associated with a given artifact alias. It takes in an object with an `artifactAlias` property and returns an `artifact` object. The `resolver` function extracts the `artifactCollection` property from the `artifactAlias` object and returns it. Like the first operation, this operation is also marked as `hidden`.

These operations are defined using the `makeStandardOp` function from the `OpKinds` module. This function takes in an object with various properties defining the operation, such as `name`, `argTypes`, `returnType`, and `resolver`. The `argTypes` object defines the expected input types for the operation, in this case just a single property `artifactAlias` of type `artifactAlias`. The `returnType` function returns the expected return type of the operation based on the input types. 

Overall, these operations provide a way for other parts of the larger project to interact with artifact aliases and retrieve information about them. For example, other parts of the project may use these operations to retrieve the alias or artifact collection associated with a given artifact alias.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `OpKinds` module that is being imported?
- The `OpKinds` module is being imported to use its `makeStandardOp` function to create standard operations.

2. What is the `resolver` function used for in each of the `opArtifactAliasAlias` and `opArtifactAliasArtifact` operations?
- The `resolver` function is used to return specific properties of the `artifactAlias` object passed as an argument to the operation.

3. What is the expected input type for the `returnType` function in each of the operations?
- The `returnType` function takes an `inputTypes` argument and returns a string indicating the expected return type of the operation. In the first operation, it returns `'string'`, and in the second operation, it returns `'artifact'`.
