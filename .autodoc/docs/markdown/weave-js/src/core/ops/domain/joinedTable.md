The `weave` project contains code that is used to manipulate and transform data tables. The code in this file is responsible for handling joined tables, which are tables that have been combined based on a common key. The purpose of this code is to expand joined tables into their constituent tables, so that they can be processed and manipulated more easily.

The `joinedTableExpansion` function takes a joined table and its inputs as arguments, and returns the constituent tables. It does this by first retrieving the artifact version of the joined table, and then using this to retrieve the constituent tables. If the constituent tables are partitioned tables, the code uses a hack to determine their type, since polymorphism is not yet supported. Finally, the function joins the constituent tables based on the common key, and returns the result.

The `opJoinedTableRowsType` function is a helper function that returns the type of the rows of a joined table. It does this by calling the `joinedTableExpansion` function and then refining the result to get the type of the rows.

The `opJoinedTableRows` function is the main function that returns the rows of a joined table. It does this by calling the `joinedTableExpansion` function and then executing the result. The function also checks that the input is a joined table, and throws an error if it is not.

The `opJoinedTableFile` function returns the file of a joined table. It does this by simply returning the input joined table.

Overall, this code is an important part of the `weave` project, since it allows joined tables to be expanded into their constituent tables, which makes them easier to manipulate and process. The code can be used by other parts of the project that need to work with joined tables. For example, the `opJoinedTableRows` function could be used by a function that needs to perform a calculation on the rows of a joined table.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `joinedTableExpansion` function?
   - The `joinedTableExpansion` function expands joined tables into their constituent tables and performs a join operation on them.
2. What is the difference between `opJoinedTableRowsType` and `opJoinedTableRows`?
   - `opJoinedTableRowsType` returns the type of the rows of a joined table, while `opJoinedTableRows` returns the actual rows of a joined table.
3. What is the purpose of the `opJoinedTableFile` function?
   - The `opJoinedTableFile` function returns the file associated with a joined table.
