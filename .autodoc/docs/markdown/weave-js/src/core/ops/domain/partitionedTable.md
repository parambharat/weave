The `weave` project contains a module that exports three functions: `opPartitionedTableRowsType`, `opPartitionedTableRows`, and `opPartitionedTableFile`. These functions are used to manipulate partitioned tables, which are tables that are split into multiple parts. 

The `opPartitionedTableRowsType` function takes a partitioned table as input and returns the type of the rows in the table. It does this by calling the `partitionedTableExpansion` function, which takes a partitioned table and returns an array of table row nodes. The `opPartitionedTableRowsType` function then refines the output of `partitionedTableExpansion` to get the type of the rows.

The `opPartitionedTableRows` function takes a partitioned table as input and returns the rows of the table. It does this by calling the `partitionedTableExpansion` function to get an array of table row nodes, and then executing those nodes to get the actual rows. The function returns the rows as an array of objects, where each object represents a row in the table.

The `opPartitionedTableFile` function takes a partitioned table as input and returns the file that contains the table. It does this by simply returning the input partitioned table.

Overall, these functions provide a way to work with partitioned tables in the `weave` project. They can be used to get the type and rows of a partitioned table, as well as the file that contains the table.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- Unfortunately, the code provided does not give any indication of the purpose of the `weave` project.

2. What is the `opPartitionedTableRows` function used for?
- The `opPartitionedTableRows` function returns the rows of a partitioned table.

3. What is the purpose of the `partitionedTableExpansion` function?
- The `partitionedTableExpansion` function takes in a partitioned table, retrieves its parts, and returns the rows of each part as an array.
