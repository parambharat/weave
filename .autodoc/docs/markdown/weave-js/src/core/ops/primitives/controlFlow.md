The `weave` project includes a file that exports two functions: `opIf` and `opLambdaClosureArgBridge`. 

`opIf` is a function that takes in an object with several properties, including `name`, `hidden`, `argTypes`, `kind`, `description`, `argDescriptions`, `returnValueDescription`, `returnType`, `resolver`, and `resolveOutputType`. This function returns an object that represents an operation. 

The purpose of `opIf` is to create an operation that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false. The `condition` property in the `argTypes` object is a boolean that represents the condition to evaluate. The `then` and `else` properties in the `argTypes` object represent the values to return if the condition is true or false, respectively. The `resolver` function evaluates the condition and returns the appropriate value. The `resolveOutputType` function determines the type of the output based on the type of the `then` and `else` values. 

`opLambdaClosureArgBridge` is a function that takes in an object with a single property `arg`. This function returns the `arg` property. The purpose of this function is to act as a barrier between lambda functions and the rest of the graph. It allows downstream operations to be associated with their upstream providers for GQL generation without adding it to the tree formally, reducing nodes traversed in the graph during other execution paths. 

These functions are not meant to be exposed externally and are marked as `hidden`. 

Example usage of `opIf`:

```
const result = opIf.resolver({condition: true, then: 'foo', else: 'bar'});
console.log(result); // 'foo'
```

Example usage of `opLambdaClosureArgBridge`:

```
const result = opLambdaClosureArgBridge.resolver({arg: 'hello'});
console.log(result); // 'hello'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `opIf` function?
- The `opIf` function is a basic operation that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.

2. Why is the `opIf` function hidden?
- The `opIf` function is hidden because it is not meant to be exposed externally, likely due to its specific use case within the project.

3. What is the purpose of the `opLambdaClosureArgBridge` function?
- The `opLambdaClosureArgBridge` function acts as a barrier between lambda functions and the rest of the graph, allowing downstream operations to be associated with their upstream providers for GQL generation without adding it to the tree formally, reducing nodes traversed in the graph during other execution paths.
