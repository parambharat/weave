The code in this file defines two operations related to types in the larger Weave project. The first operation, `opTypeString`, takes a `Type` object as input and returns its string representation. The second operation, `opTypeName`, also takes a `Type` object as input and returns its name as a string.

Both operations are defined using the `makeOp` function, which creates an operation object with various properties such as `name`, `argTypes`, `returnType`, and `resolver`. The `resolver` property is a function that takes the operation inputs and returns the operation output.

The `opTypeString` operation takes a single input argument of type `Type` and returns a string representation of that type. The `resolver` function uses the `defaultLanguageBinding.printType` function to generate the string representation. This operation is marked as `hidden`, which means it is not exposed to the user yet.

The `opTypeName` operation also takes a single input argument of type `Type` and returns a string representation of the type's name. The `resolver` function checks if the input type is a simple type shape, and if so, returns the type itself. Otherwise, it returns the type's name. This operation is also marked as `hidden`.

These operations may be used internally by other parts of the Weave project that need to work with type information. For example, they could be used by a code editor to display information about a variable's type. Here is an example of how the `opTypeString` operation could be used:

```
import {opTypeString} from 'weave';

const myType = {name: 'number', type: 'primitive'};
const typeString = await opTypeString({type: myType});
console.log(typeString); // 'number'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code is part of the `weave` project, but it is unclear what the project does or what problem it solves.

2. What is the difference between `opTypeString` and `opTypeName`?
- `opTypeString` returns the string representation of a given type, while `opTypeName` returns the name of the type as a string. It is unclear why both operations are needed or how they differ in their use cases.

3. What is the `defaultLanguageBinding` and how is it used in the `resolver` function?
- It is unclear what the `defaultLanguageBinding` is or how it is implemented. It is used in the `resolver` function to print the string representation of a given type, but it is unclear how it accomplishes this task.
