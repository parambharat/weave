The `CachedClient` class is a wrapper around a `Client` object that adds caching functionality to the `query` method. The purpose of this class is to reduce the number of network requests made by the client by caching the results of previous queries. 

The class imports several dependencies, including `Observable` from the `zen-observable` library, `Cache` and `InMemoryCache` from the `../cache` module, `Hasher` and `MemoizedHasher` from the `../model/graph/editing/hash` module, `Node` from the `../model/graph/types` module, `Type` from the `../model/types` module, and `OpStore` from the `../opStore/types` module. 

The `CachedClient` class implements the `Client` interface, which requires the implementation of several methods, including `subscribe`, `setPolling`, `isPolling`, `addOnPollingChangeListener`, `removeOnPollingChangeListener`, `query`, `action`, `loadingObservable`, `refreshAll`, and `debugMeta`. 

The `subscribe` method simply calls the `subscribe` method of the wrapped `Client` object. The `setPolling`, `isPolling`, `addOnPollingChangeListener`, and `removeOnPollingChangeListener` methods are also pass-through methods that simply call the corresponding methods of the wrapped `Client` object. 

The `query` method is where the caching functionality is implemented. If the cache already contains the result of the query for the given `Node`, the cached result is returned. Otherwise, a new `Promise` is created that subscribes to the `Node` using the wrapped `Client` object, resolves with the result, and then unsubscribes. The result is then cached for future use. 

The `action` method simply calls the `action` method of the wrapped `Client` object. The `loadingObservable` method returns an `Observable` that emits `true` when the client is loading and `false` when it is not. The `refreshAll` method simply calls the `refreshAll` method of the wrapped `Client` object. 

Finally, the `debugMeta` method returns an object containing debugging information about the `CachedClient` object, including its `id`, the `debugMeta` of the wrapped `OpStore` object, and the `debugMeta` of the wrapped `Client` object. 

Overall, the `CachedClient` class provides a way to reduce the number of network requests made by a client by caching the results of previous queries. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for a regular `Client` object in situations where caching is desired. 

Example usage:

```typescript
import {CachedClient} from 'weave';

const client = new CachedClient(myClient);

const result = await client.query(myNode); // result is cached for future use
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CachedClient` class?
- The `CachedClient` class is a wrapper around a `Client` instance that adds caching functionality to the `query` method.

2. How is caching implemented in the `CachedClient` class?
- Caching is implemented using an `InMemoryCache` instance with a maximum capacity of 1000 elements and a key function that generates a hash based on the `typedNodeId` of the input `Node`.

3. What is the role of the `MemoizedHasher` class?
- The `MemoizedHasher` class is used to memoize the hash function used by the `InMemoryCache` instance to generate keys for cached elements. This improves performance by avoiding redundant hash calculations.
