This file defines the interface for a Server in the weave project. The Server is responsible for handling queries and managing the OpStore, which is a data structure that stores operations that can be executed on a graph. 

The Server interface has three methods: 

1. `opStore`: This is a getter method that returns the OpStore object. The OpStore is used to store operations that can be executed on a graph. 

2. `query(nodes: Node[], stripTags?: boolean, resetBackendExecutionCache?: boolean): Promise<any[]>`: This method takes an array of Node objects as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of results. The `stripTags` and `resetBackendExecutionCache` parameters are optional and can be used to control the behavior of the query. 

3. `debugMeta(): {id: string} & {[prop: string]: any}`: This method returns an object that contains debugging information about the Server. 

The Server interface is used by other parts of the weave project to interact with the Server. For example, the query method can be used to execute operations on a graph and retrieve the results. Here is an example of how the query method can be used: 

```
const server: Server = // create a Server object
const nodes: Node[] = // create an array of Node objects
const results = await server.query(nodes);
console.log(results); // print the results
```

Overall, this file defines the interface for a Server in the weave project, which is responsible for handling queries and managing the OpStore. The Server interface is used by other parts of the project to interact with the Server and execute operations on a graph.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Node` and `OpStore` imports?
- The `Node` import is likely used to define the structure of nodes in a graph, while the `OpStore` import is likely used to define operations that can be performed on the graph.
2. What does the `query` method do?
- The `query` method takes in an array of nodes and optional parameters, and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of results. It is unclear what kind of query is being performed or what the results represent.
3. What is the purpose of the `debugMeta` method?
- The `debugMeta` method returns an object with an `id` property and any additional properties. It is unclear what these properties represent or how they are used for debugging purposes.
