The `RemoteHttpServer` class handles (de)serialization to send to a remote CG server. It implements the `Server` interface and has methods for querying nodes. The class takes in an object of options, which includes the URL of the remote server, an async function for retrieving an auth token, and various other options for configuring the behavior of the server. 

The `query` method takes an array of nodes and returns a promise that resolves to an array of results. The `queryEach` method is similar, but returns a promise that resolves to an array of `PromiseSettledResult` objects. 

The class maintains a `pendingNodes` map that keeps track of nodes that are waiting for a result. When a node is added to the map, a new `NodeEntry` object is created with the node, a resolve function, a reject function, a state of "waiting", and a retries count of 0. 

The `flush` method is called periodically on an interval and is responsible for sending requests to the remote server. It first checks if there are too many requests in-flight and if there are, it returns early. It then gets the next batch of waiting nodes, serializes them, and sends them to the remote server. If the server responds with an error status code, the method will retry the request up to a maximum number of times specified in the options. If the server responds with a successful status code, the method will resolve or reject each node based on the response data. 

The class also has methods for resolving and rejecting nodes, as well as a `backoff` method that sets a delay before the next flush. 

Overall, this class provides a way to query a remote CG server and handle the (de)serialization of data. It can be used in conjunction with other classes in the `weave` project to build a larger application. 

Example usage:

```
const remoteServer = new RemoteHttpServer({
  weaveUrl: 'https://example.com/execute',
  tokenFunc: async () => {
    const token = await getToken();
    return token;
  },
  maxBatchSize: 10,
});

const nodes = [node1, node2, node3];
const results = await remoteServer.query(nodes);
console.log(results); // [result1, result2, result3]

remoteServer.close();
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RemoteHttpServer` class?
- The `RemoteHttpServer` class handles (de)serialization to send to a remote CG server and provides methods for querying nodes and managing pending requests.

2. What is the purpose of the `weaveUrl` property in the `RemoteWeaveOptions` interface?
- The `weaveUrl` property specifies the URL of the remote CG server that the `RemoteHttpServer` class will communicate with.

3. What is the purpose of the `backoff` method in the `RemoteHttpServer` class?
- The `backoff` method sets a delay before the next flush of pending nodes to the remote CG server, with the delay increasing exponentially with each consecutive backoff. This is used to prevent overloading the server with too many requests at once.
