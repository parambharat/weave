This file defines the `WeaveInterface` interface, which consolidates access to all Weave-related functions. The interface includes methods for calling operations, expanding nodes, refining nodes, and providing suggestions. 

The `WeaveInterface` interface also includes methods for checking if a type is assignable to another type, converting a type to a string, and retrieving an operation definition by name. 

One notable method is `expression`, which takes an input string and an optional stack and returns a promise that resolves to an `ExpressionResult`. This method relies on parser logic from Weave and is not part of the core `WeaveInterface`. 

Another notable method is `suggestions`, which takes an editing node or editing operation, a graph, a stack, and an optional query string. This method returns a promise that resolves to an array of `AutosuggestResult` objects, which contain suggestions for completing the input. 

Overall, the `WeaveInterface` interface provides a consolidated and standardized way to access Weave-related functions. It can be used by other parts of the larger project to interact with Weave and perform various operations. 

Example usage:

```
import { WeaveInterface } from 'weave';

// create a new instance of the WeaveInterface
const weave: WeaveInterface = new WeaveInterfaceImpl();

// call an operation by name
const opDef = weave.op('add');

// expand a node
const expandedNode = await weave.expandAll(node, stack);

// refine an editing node
const refinedNode = await weave.refineEditingNode(node, stack);

// get suggestions for completing an input
const suggestions = await weave.suggestions(node, graph, stack, 'my query');
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WeaveInterface` and what methods does it provide?
- The `WeaveInterface` provides consolidated access to all weave-related functions and exports parts of the weave API. It includes methods such as `typeIsAssignableTo`, `op`, `callOp`, `expression`, `suggestions`, and more.

2. What is the purpose of the `expression` method and why is it not part of the core `WeaveInterface`?
- The `expression` method takes an input string and an optional stack and returns a Promise that resolves to an `ExpressionResult`. It is not part of the core `WeaveInterface` because it relies on a lot of parser logic from weave.

3. What is the purpose of the `expandAll` method and what does it take as input?
- The `expandAll` method takes an `EditingNode` and a `Stack` as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an `EditingNode`. Its purpose is to expand all nodes in the given `EditingNode` and return the resulting `EditingNode`.
