This file contains a method called `executeSync` that is used to execute Weave Nodes in a synchronous manner. The primary purpose of this method is to allow quick execution of small graphs, like the ones used in returnType opDefs. Most callers will access this function via the `executeNodeSync` method available in graph.ts.

The `executeSync` method takes in four parameters: `node`, `nodeResults`, `fg`, and `opStore`. `node` is the node to execute, `nodeResults` is a map of nodes to their results, `fg` is a ForwardGraph, and `opStore` is an OpStore. The method first checks if the result for the given node already exists in `nodeResults`. If it does, it returns the result. If not, it checks the type of the node. If it is an output node, it retrieves the inputs for the node and executes them recursively using `executeSync`. It then retrieves the op definition for the node and checks if it is a low-level op. If it is, it executes the resolver function for the op and sets the result. If it is not a low-level op, it throws an error. If the node is a const node, it simply returns the value of the node. If the node is invalid, it throws an error.

The file also contains a class called `ThrowingPlaceholderServer` that implements the `ServerAPI` interface. This class is used as a placeholder server that throws an error when any of its methods are called. The file also defines a `syncResolverContext` object that contains a `backend` property set to an instance of `ThrowingPlaceholderServer`. Finally, the file defines an `engineFactory` function that throws an error when called.

Overall, this file provides a method for executing Weave Nodes in a synchronous manner, as well as some supporting classes and functions. It is likely used in the larger Weave project to execute small graphs and return type opDefs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `executeSync` function?
- The purpose of the `executeSync` function is to execute Weave Nodes in a synchronous manner, primarily for quick execution of small graphs.

2. What is the `ThrowingPlaceholderServer` class used for?
- The `ThrowingPlaceholderServer` class is used as a placeholder server API that throws errors when its methods are called.

3. What is the `syncResolverContext` object used for?
- The `syncResolverContext` object is a resolver context that contains a `ThrowingPlaceholderServer` instance as its backend and an empty frame. It is used in the execution of low-level opDefs in the `executeSync` function.
