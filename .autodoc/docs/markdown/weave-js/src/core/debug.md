The code provided is a utility function that is useful for console debugging. It exports a function called `op` that takes in an `opName` string and returns a function that takes in any number of arguments. The purpose of this function is to provide a way to easily access and execute operations defined in the `StaticOpStore` class.

The `op` function first checks if the `globalThis` object is defined and if the `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant is set to true. If both conditions are met, it attaches the `op` function to the global object for easy access in the console.

When the `op` function is called with an `opName` string, it retrieves the corresponding operation definition from the `StaticOpStore` instance. If the operation definition is not found, it throws a `TypeError`. Otherwise, it creates an object that maps the positional arguments to the input object keys defined in the operation definition. If any positional argument is undefined, it throws a `TypeError`. If the positional argument is not an object, it wraps it in a const node object with the type and value of the argument.

If the operation definition is low-level, it executes the operation with the input object as the argument and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns null.

This utility function can be used to quickly test and debug operations defined in the `StaticOpStore` class. For example, if we have an operation called `add` that takes in two numbers and returns their sum, we can use the `op` function to execute it in the console:

```
op('add')(2, 3); // returns 5
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `StaticOpStore` and `opDefIsLowLevel` imports?
- The `StaticOpStore` import is used to access the list of all available operations, while the `opDefIsLowLevel` import is used to check if a given operation is low-level or not.

2. What is the purpose of the `op` function and how is it used?
- The `op` function is used for console debugging and takes in an operation name as a parameter. It then returns a function that takes in arguments for the operation and maps them to an input object. If the operation is low-level, it calls the operation with the input object and returns the result.

3. What is the purpose of the `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant and how is it used?
- The `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant is used to determine whether or not to attach the `op` function to the global `this` object for console debugging. If it is set to `true` and the `globalThis` object exists, the `op` function is attached to it.
