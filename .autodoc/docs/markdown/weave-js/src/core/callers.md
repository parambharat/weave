The `callFunction` function in the `weave` project is used to construct a new node that represents a function call. It takes two arguments: a `functionNode` and an `inputs` object. The `functionNode` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `inputs` object represents the set of arguments that are passed to the function. The function dereferences variables including walking const functions. It also updates the types when it replaces variables. The `dereferenceVariablesFromFrame` function is used to dereference variables including walking const functions. It takes two arguments: a `functionNode` and a `variables` object. The `functionNode` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `variables` object represents the set of variables that are used in the function. The `dereferenceAllVars` function is used to dereference all variables in a node. It takes two arguments: a `node` and a `stack`. The `node` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `stack` is an array of frames that represent the environment in which the node is evaluated. The `getUnresolvedVarNodes` function is used to get all unresolved variable nodes in a node. It takes one argument: a `node` that terminates at variables or constants. The `mapNodes` function is used to map over all nodes in a node. It takes three arguments: a `node`, a `mapFn` function, and an `excludeFnBodies` boolean. The `mapFn` function is applied to each node in the node, and the `excludeFnBodies` boolean is used to exclude function bodies from the mapping. The `callOpVeryUnsafe` function is used to call an operation with a set of inputs and an output type. It takes three arguments: an `opName`, an `inputs` object, and an `outputType`. The `isFunctionLiteral` function is used to check if a node is a function literal. It takes one argument: a `maybeFunction` node. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import { callFunction } from 'weave';

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const result = callFunction(add, { a, b }); // result is 3
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `callFunction` function?
- `callFunction` takes a function node and a set of argument nodes, and constructs a new node that represents the function call. It dereferences variables and const functions, and returns the resulting node.

2. What is the purpose of the `dereferenceAllVars` function?
- `dereferenceAllVars` takes a node and a stack, and replaces all variable nodes with their corresponding values in the stack. It also pushes variables into the environment for lambdas, so that when they are encountered in the body, they are swapped for the same variable.

3. What is the purpose of the `mapNodes` function?
- `mapNodes` performs a post-order traversal of a node, and applies a mapping function to each node. It can exclude function bodies from the mapping, and only replaces a node if an input has changed. It is used to implement `callOpValid` and `findAndReplaceNode`.
