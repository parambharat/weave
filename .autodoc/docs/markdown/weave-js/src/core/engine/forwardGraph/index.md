The code above is a module that exports two functions, `newForwardGraph()` and `newRefForwardGraph()`, as well as some types and utilities. These functions create instances of a `BaseForwardGraph` class, which is defined in another file called `base.ts`. The `BaseForwardGraph` class takes a storage object as an argument, which can be either a `HashingStorage` or a `RefStorage` object, depending on which function is called.

The purpose of this module is to provide a way to create instances of a forward graph, which is a data structure used in the larger project. A forward graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents a computation graph, where nodes represent operations and edges represent data dependencies between those operations. The forward graph is used to track the flow of data through the computation graph and to perform automatic differentiation.

The `newForwardGraph()` function creates a forward graph with a `HashingStorage` object, which is a storage implementation that uses a hash table to store nodes and edges. This implementation is efficient for small to medium-sized graphs. The `newRefForwardGraph()` function creates a forward graph with a `RefStorage` object, which is a storage implementation that uses a reference counting scheme to manage memory. This implementation is more memory-efficient for large graphs.

Here is an example of how to use these functions:

```typescript
import { newForwardGraph } from 'weave';

const graph = newForwardGraph();

// Add nodes and edges to the graph
const a = graph.addOp('input', []);
const b = graph.addOp('input', []);
const c = graph.addOp('add', [a, b]);
const d = graph.addOp('mul', [c, b]);

// Evaluate the graph
const inputs = { [a]: 2, [b]: 3 };
const outputs = graph.evaluate([d], inputs);

console.log(outputs); // { [d]: 15 }
```

In this example, we create a new forward graph using `newForwardGraph()`. We then add four nodes to the graph: two input nodes (`a` and `b`), an addition node (`c`) that depends on `a` and `b`, and a multiplication node (`d`) that depends on `c` and `b`. We then evaluate the graph by passing in the output node (`d`) and an object that maps input nodes to their values. The `evaluate()` method returns an object that maps output nodes to their values. In this case, the output value of `d` is `15`, which is the result of `(2 + 3) * 3`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BaseForwardGraph` class and how is it used in this code?
   - The `BaseForwardGraph` class is imported from the `base` module and is used to create instances of a forward graph. It is used in the `newForwardGraph` and `newRefForwardGraph` functions to create new instances of a forward graph with different types of storage.
2. What is the difference between `HashingStorage` and `RefStorage` and how do they affect the behavior of the forward graph?
   - `HashingStorage` and `RefStorage` are two different implementations of the storage mechanism for the forward graph. `HashingStorage` uses a hash table to store the values, while `RefStorage` uses a reference-based approach. The choice of storage mechanism can affect the performance and memory usage of the forward graph.
3. What is the purpose of the `ForwardOp` type and how is it used in this code?
   - The `ForwardOp` type is exported from the `types` module and is used to define the signature of a function that can be added to the forward graph as an operation. It is also re-exported from this module along with the `ForwardGraph` type.
