The `BaseForwardGraph` class in this code is responsible for managing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operations (Ops) and their relationships. The graph represents a computation pipeline, where each Op performs a specific task and passes its output to the next Op(s) in the pipeline. The code focuses on managing the relationships between Ops, specifically handling "tag" consumers and creators.

Tags are used to associate specific Ops with their corresponding input or output data. The code provides several utility functions to determine if an Op is a tag consumer or creator, and to extract and connect tag consumers with their respective tag creators.

The `updateForwardGraphVisitOp` function is the core function for updating the graph when a new node is added or an existing node is updated. It handles the traversal of the graph, updating the relationships between Ops, and connecting tag providers and consumers.

The `connectTagProviderToConsumers` function is responsible for associating tag consumers with their corresponding tag creators. It ensures that the correct input data is passed between Ops in the pipeline.

The `BaseForwardGraph` class can be used in a larger project to manage a computation pipeline, allowing for efficient updates and traversal of the graph as new operations are added or existing operations are modified.

Example usage:

```javascript
const graph = new BaseForwardGraph(storage);
graph.update(node);
const roots = graph.getRoots();
```

In this example, a new `BaseForwardGraph` instance is created with a given storage, a node is updated, and the root nodes of the graph are retrieved.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `isTagConsumer` and `isTagCreator` functions, and how do they determine if an operation is a tag consumer or creator?
   **Answer**: The `isTagConsumer` function checks if a given `forwardOp` is a tag consumer operation by checking its name against a hardcoded list of supported operations. Similarly, the `isTagCreator` function checks if a given `sourceOp` is a tag creator for a specific `targetOpName` by checking its name against a hardcoded list of supported operations and following certain naming conventions. These functions help in determining the relationship between operations in terms of tag consumption and creation.

2. **Question**: What is the role of the `getLambdaFunctionNodes` function, and why are there several hardcoded operations within it?
   **Answer**: The `getLambdaFunctionNodes` function is responsible for retrieving the lambda function nodes associated with a given `forwardOp`. It has hardcoded operations because it currently supports only a specific set of operations and needs to re-implement the way these operations apply lambda functions to their inputs, which is hidden at the moment. The TODO comments indicate that this should be made more generic in the future.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `BaseForwardGraph` class, and how does it interact with the `ForwardGraphStorage`?
   **Answer**: The `BaseForwardGraph` class implements the `ForwardGraph` interface and serves as the base class for managing and updating the forward graph representation of the operations. It interacts with the `ForwardGraphStorage` by using it to store and retrieve `ForwardOp` instances, as well as to manage the root operations in the graph. The class provides methods for updating the graph, connecting tag providers and consumers, and traversing the graph.
