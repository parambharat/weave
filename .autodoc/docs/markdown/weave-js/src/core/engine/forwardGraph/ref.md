The code above defines a class called `RefStorage` that implements the `ForwardGraphStorage` interface. This class is part of the larger `weave` project and is responsible for storing and managing references to forward operations in a graph.

The `RefStorage` class has two private properties: `roots` and `ops`. The `roots` property is a `Set` that stores references to all the root operations in the graph. The `ops` property is a `Map` that stores references to all the forward operations in the graph. 

The `RefStorage` class has four methods: `getRoots()`, `getOp()`, `setOp()`, and `size()`. 

The `getRoots()` method returns the `roots` set, which contains references to all the root operations in the graph. 

The `getOp()` method takes an operation (`GraphTypes.Op`) as an argument and returns the corresponding forward operation (`ForwardOp`) from the `ops` map. If the operation is not found in the map, `undefined` is returned.

The `setOp()` method takes a forward operation (`ForwardOp`) as an argument and adds it to the `ops` map. The key for the map is the `op` property of the forward operation.

The `size()` method returns the number of forward operations stored in the `ops` map.

This class is likely used in conjunction with other classes in the `weave` project to build and manipulate a graph of operations. For example, the `setOp()` method may be called when a new forward operation is added to the graph, and the `getRoots()` method may be used to retrieve all the root operations in the graph. 

Here is an example of how the `RefStorage` class may be used:

```
const storage = new RefStorage();
const op1 = new ForwardOp();
const op2 = new ForwardOp();
storage.setOp(op1);
storage.setOp(op2);
console.log(storage.size()); // Output: 2
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RefStorage` class?
- The `RefStorage` class is a implementation of the `ForwardGraphStorage` interface and provides methods for managing a set of `ForwardOp` objects and their relationships.

2. What is the significance of the `roots` and `ops` properties?
- The `roots` property is a set of `ForwardOp` objects that are considered the starting points of the graph. The `ops` property is a map that associates `GraphTypes.Op` objects with their corresponding `ForwardOp` objects.

3. What is the expected behavior of the `setOp` method?
- The `setOp` method adds a `ForwardOp` object to the `ops` map, using its `op` property as the key.
