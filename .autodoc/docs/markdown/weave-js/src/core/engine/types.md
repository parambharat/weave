The code defines an interface called `Engine` that is used in the larger `weave` project. The `Engine` interface has two methods: `executeNodes` and `mapNode`. 

The `executeNodes` method takes an array of executable nodes and asynchronously resolves them for a result. The `targetNodes` parameter is an array of `NodeOrVoidNode` types, which are nodes that can either be a regular node or a void node. The `stripTags` parameter is an optional boolean that determines whether or not to strip tags from the result. The `resetBackendExecutionCache` parameter is also an optional boolean that determines whether or not to reset the backend execution cache. The method returns a promise that resolves to an array of any type.

Here is an example of how to use the `executeNodes` method:

```
const nodes = [node1, node2, node3];
const engine = new EngineImpl(opStore);
engine.executeNodes(nodes, true, false)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

The `mapNode` method takes a function node and an array of inputs, calls the function node over each element in the input, and returns an array of results. The `node` parameter is a `NodeOrVoidNode` type, which is a node that can either be a regular node or a void node. The `inputs` parameter is an array of any type that represents the inputs to the function node. The `stripTags` parameter is an optional boolean that determines whether or not to strip tags from the result. The method returns a promise that resolves to an array of any type.

Here is an example of how to use the `mapNode` method:

```
const node = functionNode;
const inputs = [input1, input2, input3];
const engine = new EngineImpl(opStore);
engine.mapNode(node, inputs, true)
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Engine` interface?
   - The `Engine` interface defines the methods and properties that an engine object should have, including an `opStore` property and two methods for executing nodes and mapping nodes.
2. What is the `executeNodes` method used for?
   - The `executeNodes` method takes an array of executable nodes and resolves them asynchronously for a result. It also has optional parameters for stripping tags and resetting the backend execution cache.
3. What is the `mapNode` method used for?
   - The `mapNode` method takes a function node and an array of inputs, calls the function node over each element in the input, and returns an array of results. It also has an optional parameter for stripping tags.
