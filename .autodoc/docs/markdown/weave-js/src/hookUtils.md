The `weave` project contains a file with various custom hooks that can be used in React applications. The file imports several dependencies, including `lodash`, `react`, and `react-intersection-observer`. 

The first hook, `usePrevious`, is a custom hook that returns the previous value of a given state. It takes a generic type `T` as an argument and returns a value of type `T | undefined`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the previous value and the `useEffect` hook to update the reference when the value changes. This hook can be used to compare the current value of a state with its previous value and perform some action based on the comparison.

The `useDeepMemo` hook is another custom hook that returns a new value only if the value changes by deep comparison from one call to the next. It takes a generic type `T` and an optional function `equalityFn` as arguments and returns a value of type `T`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the previous value and the `usePrevious` hook to get the previous value. If the current value is not equal to the previous value based on the `equalityFn` function, it updates the reference with the current value. This hook can be used to optimize the performance of a component by memoizing a value that is expensive to compute.

The `useGatedValue` hook is a custom hook that returns `true` when a given value becomes `onScreen` for the first time after a certain condition is met. It takes a generic type `T` and a function `updateWhen` as arguments and returns a value of type `T`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the current value and updates the reference only if the value changes and the `updateWhen` function returns `true`. This hook can be used to trigger an action when a certain value becomes visible on the screen.

The `useSyncedState` hook is a custom hook that synchronizes the state of a component with the state of another component. It takes an object with two properties, `stateToSyncWith` and `setStateToSyncWith`, as an argument and returns an object with two properties, `state` and `setState`. It uses the `useState` hook to initialize the state and the `useEffect` hook to update the state when the `stateToSyncWith` changes. It also uses the `useCallback` hook to create a function that updates both states when the `setState` function is called. This hook can be used to keep the state of two components in sync.

The `useStateWithRef` hook is a custom hook that returns an array with three values, the state, the `setState` function, and a mutable ref object. It takes an initial value as an argument and uses the `useState` and `useRef` hooks to initialize the state and the ref object. It also uses the `useCallback` hook to create a function that updates both the state and the ref object when the `setState` function is called. This hook can be used to keep a reference to the previous state of a component.

The `useUpdatingState` hook is a custom hook that returns an array with two values, the state and the `setState` function. It takes an initial value as an argument and uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to initialize the state and update it when the initial value changes. This hook can be used to update the state of a component when the initial value changes.

The `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook is a custom hook that returns an array with two values, a ref object and a boolean. It takes a value and a debounce time in milliseconds as arguments and uses the `useInView`, `usePrevious`, and `useState` hooks to determine when the value becomes visible on the screen after a certain debounce time. It also uses the `useRef` hook to store the mount moment and the current moment and the `useEffect` hook to update the state when the value changes or the debounce time elapses. This hook can be used to trigger an action when a certain value becomes visible on the screen after a certain debounce time.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useDeepMemo` hook?
- The `useDeepMemo` hook returns a memoized value only if the value has changed by deep comparison from one call to the next.

2. What is the purpose of the `useSyncedState` hook?
- The `useSyncedState` hook returns a state and a setState function that are synced with an external state and setState function passed as parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook?
- The `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook returns a ref and a boolean value indicating whether the ref is on screen for the first time after a new value has been debounced.
