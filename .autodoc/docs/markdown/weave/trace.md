The `weave` module contains functions for working with artifacts and runs in the larger project. The `get_obj_creator` function takes a reference to an artifact and returns the run that created it. It does this by iterating through all the artifacts in the local artifact directory and checking if any of them created the given artifact. If the artifact is a list, it checks each run in the list to see if it created the artifact. If the artifact is not found or cannot be deserialized, it continues to the next artifact. If the run that created the artifact is found, it is returned. If no run is found, `None` is returned.

The `get_obj_expr` function takes an object and returns a graph node that represents the object. If the object is not a reference, a constant node is returned with the object's type and value. If the object is a reference, the function calls `get_obj_creator` to find the run that created the object. If a run is found, an output node is returned with the object's type, the name of the operation that created the object, and the inputs to that operation. If no run is found, a constant node is returned with the reference.

The `used_by` function takes a reference to an artifact and the name of an operation and returns a list of runs that use the artifact as an input to the given operation. It does this by iterating through all the artifacts in the local artifact directory and checking if any of them have a run with the given operation name and the given artifact as an input. If a run is found, it is added to the list of users. The function returns the list of users.

These functions are useful for working with artifacts and runs in the larger project. For example, `get_obj_creator` can be used to find the run that created an artifact, which can be useful for debugging or tracing the lineage of an artifact. `get_obj_expr` can be used to create a graph node that represents an object, which can be useful for building a computation graph. `used_by` can be used to find all the runs that use an artifact as an input to a given operation, which can be useful for analyzing the impact of changing an artifact on downstream runs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how does this file fit into the overall project?
- The `weave` module appears to be a collection of submodules related to managing artifacts and runs in a machine learning workflow. This file specifically contains functions for retrieving the creator of an object and finding runs that use a given reference in a specific operation.
2. What is the purpose of the `get_obj_creator` function and how does it work?
- The `get_obj_creator` function takes a reference to an object and returns the run that created it, if one exists. It does this by iterating through all local artifacts and checking if any of them created the object in question. If the object is a list, it checks each run in the list to see if it created the object. If the object is not found or cannot be deserialized, it continues to the next artifact.
3. What is the purpose of the `used_by` function and how does it work?
- The `used_by` function takes a reference and an operation name and returns a list of runs that use the reference in that operation. It does this by iterating through all local artifacts and checking if any of them have the specified operation name and use the reference as an input. If a run is found, it is added to a list of users that is returned at the end.
