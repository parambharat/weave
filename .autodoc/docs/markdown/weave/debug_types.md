The `weave` project includes a module that contains a function called `why_not_assignable` and an auxiliary function called `short_type`. The purpose of `why_not_assignable` is to determine whether two types are assignable to each other. If they are not, the function returns a string that explains why they are not assignable. If they are assignable, the function returns `None`. The function takes two arguments, `to_type` and `from_type`, which are instances of the `Type` class defined in the `weave_types` module. 

The function first checks if either `to_type` or `from_type` is an instance of the `Any` class, which is a special type that can be assigned to any other type. If either of them is `Any`, the function returns `None`. If neither of them is `Any`, the function checks if `from_type` is a union type. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with each member of the union type until it finds a member that is not assignable to `to_type`. If it finds such a member, it adds a reason to a list of reasons why the types are not assignable. If `from_type` is not a union type, the function checks if `to_type` is a union type and recursively calls itself with each member of `to_type` until it finds a member that is not assignable from `from_type`. If it finds such a member, it adds a reason to the list of reasons. 

The function then checks for several other cases where the types are not assignable, such as when `from_type` is a `TaggedValueType` and `to_type` is not, or when `from_type` is a `Const` and `to_type` is not. If none of these cases apply, the function checks if `to_type` and `from_type` are functions, and if so, recursively calls itself with the output type of `from_type` and `to_type`. If `from_type` is a `TypedDict` and `to_type` is a `Dict`, the function recursively calls itself with the object type of `to_type` and each property type of `from_type`. If `from_type` and `to_type` are both `TypedDict`s, the function recursively calls itself with each property type of `to_type` and the corresponding property type of `from_type`. If `to_type` and `from_type` have the same name, the function recursively calls itself with each type variable of `to_type` and the corresponding attribute of `from_type`. If none of these cases apply, the function adds a reason to the list of reasons that the types are not assignable. 

Finally, the function checks if the implementation above matches the actual assignability implementation. If the function found reasons why the types are not assignable but the actual assignability implementation says they are assignable, or if the function did not find any reasons but the actual assignability implementation says they are not assignable, the function prints an error message. Otherwise, the function returns `None`. 

`short_type` is a simple function that takes a `Type` instance and returns a string representation of it. If the string representation is longer than 40 characters, the function truncates it and adds an ellipsis. This function is used by `why_not_assignable` to generate the string that explains why the types are not assignable. 

Example usage:

```
from weave.weave_types import Int, Float

# These types are assignable
assert why_not_assignable(Int(), Int()) is None
assert why_not_assignable(Float(), Float()) is None
assert why_not_assignable(Int(), Float()) is None

# These types are not assignable
assert why_not_assignable(Int(), Float()) == "<Int> !<- <Float>\nIncompatible types"
assert why_not_assignable(Float(), Int()) == "<Float> !<- <Int>\nIncompatible types"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` module and how is it related to this code?
- The `weave_types` module is imported in this code and contains type definitions used in the implementation of `why_not_assignable()`. A smart developer might want to know more about the types defined in `weave_types` and how they are used in this code.

2. What is the expected input and output of the `why_not_assignable()` function?
- The `why_not_assignable()` function takes two arguments of type `Type` and returns either `None` or a string explaining why the types are not assignable. A smart developer might want to know more about the expected behavior of this function and how it is used in the project.

3. What is the purpose of the `short_type()` function and how is it used in this code?
- The `short_type()` function takes a `Type` object and returns a string representation of the type that is truncated to 40 characters. It is used in the implementation of `why_not_assignable()` to format error messages. A smart developer might want to want to know more about how this function is used and whether there are any other functions that perform similar tasks in the project.
