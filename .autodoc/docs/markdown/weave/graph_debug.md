The `weave` module contains functions for simplifying and manipulating directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of operations and their inputs and outputs. The `combine_common_nodes` function takes a list of output nodes and simplifies the DAG by combining similar structures. The resulting nodes are no longer executable, but can be used for debugging and printing. 

The `to_assignment_form` function takes a list of output nodes and returns a dictionary of assignments, where each key is an output node and each value is a variable node. The function walks the DAG and replaces nodes with variables pointing to assignments that have already been created. The resulting assignments can be used to generate code that executes the DAG. 

The `node_expr_str_full` function takes a node and returns a string representation of the node as an expression. The function is a modified version of `node_expr_str` and includes the full names of the operations. 

The `_CombinedConstVal` class is a special value used to represent the combination of multiple values in debug output. 

Overall, these functions provide useful tools for working with DAGs in the larger `weave` project. 

Example usage of `combine_common_nodes`:

```
import weave.graph as graph

# create some nodes
a = graph.ConstNode(int, 1)
b = graph.ConstNode(int, 2)
c = graph.ConstNode(int, 3)
d = graph.ConstNode(int, 4)

# create some operations
op1 = graph.OperationNode("add", {"a": a, "b": b})
op2 = graph.OperationNode("add", {"c": c, "d": d})
op3 = graph.OperationNode("mul", {"x": op1, "y": op2})

# create some output nodes
output1 = graph.OutputNode(int, "output1", {"z": op1})
output2 = graph.OutputNode(int, "output2", {"w": op3})

# combine common nodes
new_outputs = combine_common_nodes([output1, output2])
```

Example usage of `to_assignment_form`:

```
import weave.graph as graph

# create some nodes
a = graph.ConstNode(int, 1)
b = graph.ConstNode(int, 2)
c = graph.ConstNode(int, 3)
d = graph.ConstNode(int, 4)

# create some operations
op1 = graph.OperationNode("add", {"a": a, "b": b})
op2 = graph.OperationNode("add", {"c": c, "d": d})
op3 = graph.OperationNode("mul", {"x": op1, "y": op2})

# create some output nodes
output1 = graph.OutputNode(int, "output1", {"z": op1})
output2 = graph.OutputNode(int, "output2", {"w": op3})

# get assignments
assignments = to_assignment_form([output1, output2])

# generate code
code = assignments_string(assignments)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `combine_common_nodes` function do?
    
    `combine_common_nodes` takes a list of output nodes and simplifies them by combining similar structures. It produces new nodes that are no longer executable, but can be used for debugging and printing.

2. What is the purpose of the `to_assignment_form` function?
    
    `to_assignment_form` takes a list of output nodes and converts them into a dictionary of assignments, where each assignment is a variable node assigned to an output node. This is useful for generating code that assigns the output of a weave graph to variables.

3. What is the `node_expr_str_full` function used for?
    
    `node_expr_str_full` is used to print a node as an expression string, with full op names. It is a modified version of `node_expr_str` that includes additional op names for certain types of nodes.
