This code defines a class called `Ref` and some helper functions for working with references to objects in the larger `weave` project. The `Ref` class represents a reference to an object and provides methods for getting and setting the object it refers to. 

The `Ref` class has several properties and methods that allow it to interact with the larger `weave` project. The `obj` property returns the object that the reference refers to. If the object has not been saved, `obj` returns `None`. The `type` property returns the type of the object that the reference refers to. The `get` method returns the object that the reference refers to, and the `_get` method is used internally to retrieve the object. The `from_str` method creates a new `Ref` object from a string representation of a URI. 

The `get_ref` function takes an object and returns a `Ref` object if the object has a reference associated with it. The `clear_ref` function removes the reference associated with an object. The `deref` function takes a `Ref` object and returns the object it refers to. 

Overall, this code provides a way to work with references to objects in the larger `weave` project. It allows objects to be referenced and dereferenced, and provides a way to create new references from URIs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Ref` class?
    
    The `Ref` class is used to store references to objects and provides methods for retrieving and manipulating those references.

2. What is the significance of the `REFS` variable?
    
    The `REFS` variable is a `WeakValueDictionary` that stores `Ref` objects if they cannot be attached directly to the object.

3. What is the purpose of the `get_ref` function?
    
    The `get_ref` function is used to retrieve the `Ref` object associated with a given object, if one exists.
