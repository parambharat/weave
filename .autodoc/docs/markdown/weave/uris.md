This code defines two data classes, `WeaveURI` and `WeaveRuntimeURI`, which are used to represent URIs in the Weave project. `WeaveURI` is the base class, and `WeaveRuntimeURI` is a subclass that is used when the Weave object is constructed at runtime.

The `WeaveURI` class has a class variable `SCHEME` that is used to identify the URI type. It also has three instance variables: `name`, which is a string representing the name of the URI; `version`, which is an optional string representing the version of the URI; and `query`, which is a dictionary representing the query parameters of the URI.

The `WeaveURI` class has several methods. The `from_parsed_uri` method is a class method that is used to parse a URI into an appropriate `WeaveURI` subclass. The `parse` method is a class method that is used to parse an object URI into its appropriate `WeaveURI` subclass. The `__str__` method is a special method that is used to return a string representation of the `WeaveURI` object. The `to_ref` method is a method that is used to convert a `WeaveURI` object to a `ref_base.Ref` object.

The `WeaveRuntimeURI` class is a subclass of `WeaveURI` that is used when the Weave object is constructed at runtime. It has a class variable `SCHEME` that is an empty string. It also has a `from_parsed_uri` method that is used to parse a URI into a `WeaveRuntimeURI` object.

Overall, these classes are used to represent URIs in the Weave project. They provide a way to parse URIs and convert them to appropriate objects, and they provide a way to convert `WeaveURI` objects to `ref_base.Ref` objects. These classes are likely used extensively throughout the Weave project to represent and manipulate URIs. 

Example usage:

```
uri = WeaveRuntimeURI("example", "1.0")
print(uri)  # prints "example:1.0"

parsed_uri = WeaveURI.parse("weave://example/1.0?param=value")
print(parsed_uri.name)  # prints "example"
print(parsed_uri.version)  # prints "1.0"
print(parsed_uri.query)  # prints {"param": ["value"]}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `WeaveURI` class and how is it used?
- The `WeaveURI` class is a base class for URI objects in the Weave project. It provides a `parse` method for parsing URIs into the appropriate subclass, and a `to_ref` method for converting the URI to a reference object. Subclasses of `WeaveURI` are used to represent different types of Weave objects.

2. What is the purpose of the `WeaveRuntimeURI` subclass and how does it differ from the `WeaveURI` class?
- The `WeaveRuntimeURI` subclass is used to represent URIs for Weave objects that are constructed at runtime, such as built-in objects or user-defined objects. It is a subclass of `WeaveURI` and overrides the `from_parsed_uri` and `__str__` methods to handle the parsing and string representation of runtime URIs.

3. What is the purpose of the `from_parsed_uri` method and how is it used?
- The `from_parsed_uri` method is a class method that is used to create a `WeaveURI` object from a parsed URI. It takes the parsed URI components as arguments and returns a new `WeaveURI` object or one of its subclasses, depending on the URI scheme. The method is called by the `parse` method of `WeaveURI` to create the appropriate object for a given URI.
