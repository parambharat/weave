This file contains several functions related to data comparison and conversion in the Weave project. The `weave` module is imported along with `pyarrow` and several other modules from the project. 

The `_to_compare_safe_call` function is a reimplementation of the `toSafeCall` function from Weave0. It takes an `OutputNode` object from the project's `graph` module and returns a new `OutputNode` object with media converted to their digest. The function checks the type of the input node and performs different operations depending on the type. If the node is an `ArtifactAssetType`, the function returns the SHA256 hash of the node. If the node is a `TypedDict`, the function recursively calls itself on each key-value pair in the dictionary and returns a new dictionary with the converted values. If the node is a `List`, the function joins the list elements into a string. 

The `_eq_null_consumer_helper` function takes two `pyarrow` arrays or scalars as input and returns two arrays indicating which elements are null in each input and which elements are null in both inputs. This function is used by the `not_equal` and `equal` functions to handle null values in the input data. 

The `not_equal` function takes two `pyarrow` arrays or scalars as input and returns a new array with boolean values indicating whether the corresponding elements in the input arrays are not equal. The function uses the `_eq_null_consumer_helper` function to handle null values in the input data and replaces null values with appropriate boolean values in the output array. 

The `equal` function is similar to `not_equal` but returns a new array with boolean values indicating whether the corresponding elements in the input arrays are equal. The function also uses the `_eq_null_consumer_helper` function to handle null values and replaces null values with appropriate boolean values in the output array. 

These functions are likely used in the larger Weave project for data comparison and conversion tasks. The `_to_compare_safe_call` function may be used to convert media to their digest for comparison purposes, while the `not_equal` and `equal` functions may be used to compare data arrays and handle null values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `_to_compare_safe_call` function?
- The `_to_compare_safe_call` function is a reimplementation of Weave0 `toSafeCall` which converts media to their digest.

2. What is the purpose of the `not_equal` and `equal` functions?
- The `not_equal` and `equal` functions are used to compare two arrays or a scalar and an array for equality and return a boolean array indicating the result.

3. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` and `graph` imports?
- The `weave_types` and `graph` imports are used in the code and are likely part of the `weave` project, but without more context it is unclear what their specific purpose is within this file.
