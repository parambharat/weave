The `weave` module contains code for converting types from Weave0 to Weave1. The purpose of this code is to provide compatibility between the two versions of Weave, allowing users to migrate their data from Weave0 to Weave1 seamlessly. 

The module defines a `Weave0TypeJson` class, which is a `TypedDict` that represents a type in Weave0. The `weave0_type_json_to_weave1_type` function takes an instance of `Weave0TypeJson` and returns an instance of `Type` from Weave1. The `Type` class is defined in the `weave_types` module, which is imported at the beginning of the file. 

The `weave0_type_json_to_weave1_type` function calls the `_convert_type` function, which takes an instance of `Weave0TypeJson` and returns an instance of `Type`. The `_convert_type` function first extracts the name of the type from the `wb_type` field of the `Weave0TypeJson` instance. It then checks the name of the type and returns an instance of the corresponding `Type` subclass from Weave1. 

The `_convert_type` function handles several types of Weave0 types, including primitive types like `none`, `boolean`, `number`, and `string`, as well as container types like `list` and `typedDict`. It also handles domain types like `timestamp` and media types like `image-file`, `audio-file`, and `html-file`. 

The `_convert_type` function also handles legacy fallback types, which are types that are not recognized by Weave1. In this case, it returns an instance of `UnknownType`. 

Overall, this code provides a way to convert types from Weave0 to Weave1, allowing users to migrate their data from Weave0 to Weave1 without losing any information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave0_type_json_to_weave1_type` function?
- The `weave0_type_json_to_weave1_type` function is used to convert a Weave0 type JSON object to a Weave1 type object.

2. What are the different types of media that this code supports?
- This code supports several types of media, including image files, audio files, HTML files, Bokeh files, video files, and 3D object files.

3. What is the purpose of the `primary_key_type_names`, `foreign_key_type_names`, and `foreign_index_type_names` sets?
- These sets are used to identify different types of table keys in Weave0, specifically primary keys, foreign keys, and foreign indexes.
