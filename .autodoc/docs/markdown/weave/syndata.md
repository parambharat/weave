The `weave` project includes a module that generates random metrics for use in testing and development. The module includes a list of functions that generate different types of metrics, such as metrics that simulate decreasing loss or increasing accuracy. These functions are stored in a list called `value_fns`. 

The `random_metrics_template` function takes an integer argument `n_metrics` and returns a list of `n_metrics` random integers between 0 and the length of `value_fns`. This list is used to select which functions from `value_fns` to use when generating metrics.

The `random_metrics` function generates a set of metrics based on the specified parameters. It takes three arguments: `n` (the number of steps), `n_metrics` (the number of metrics to generate), and `template` (an optional list of integers that specifies which functions from `value_fns` to use). 

The function first generates an array of steps using `np.arange`. It then creates a dictionary called `data` that includes the step array and a randomly generated string column. For each metric, the function selects a function from `value_fns` based on the `template` argument (if provided) or randomly otherwise. It then generates an array of values using the selected function and adds noise to the array based on a randomly selected noise type (uniform, normal, or triangular). The function also applies a filter to the noise to simulate more natural variations. The resulting array of values is added to the `data` dictionary with a key of the form `metric{j}`.

The function returns an `ArrowWeaveList` object that contains a PyArrow table with the generated metrics.

The `random_runs` function generates a set of runs based on the specified parameters. It takes three arguments: `n_runs` (the number of runs to generate), `n_steps` (the number of steps per run), and `n_metrics` (the number of metrics per step). 

The function generates a list of runs by calling `random_metrics` for each run and concatenating the resulting tables using PyArrow's `concat_arrays` function. It then creates a PyArrow struct array for each run that includes a randomly generated ID, a randomly generated configuration, and the metrics generated by `random_metrics`. The function returns an `ArrowWeaveList` object that contains a PyArrow table with the generated runs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `value_fns` list?
- The `value_fns` list contains lambda functions that simulate different types of metrics for training models.

2. What is the purpose of the `random_metrics_template` function?
- The `random_metrics_template` function generates a list of random indices that correspond to the `value_fns` list, which can be used as a template for generating random metrics.

3. What is the purpose of the `random_runs` function?
- The `random_runs` function generates a list of random runs, each containing a unique ID, configuration, and history of metrics generated by the `random_metrics` function.
