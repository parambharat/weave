The code defines two classes, `EachColumnConfig` and `EachColumn`, which are used in the larger `weave` project. 

`EachColumnConfig` is a generic class that takes a type parameter `RenderType`. It has three attributes: `layoutMode`, which is a string that specifies the layout mode for the panel; `pbLayoutConfig`, which is an optional `PanelBankSectionConfig` object that specifies the configuration for the panel bank section; and `render`, which is a `RenderType` object that specifies the rendering for the panel. The `render` attribute has a default value of `graph.VoidNode()`, which is a function that returns an empty graph node.

`EachColumn` is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and has an `id` attribute set to `"EachColumn"`. It also has an optional `config` attribute of type `EachColumnConfig`. 

These classes can be used in the larger `weave` project to create panels with specific configurations and renderings. For example, a developer could create an instance of `EachColumnConfig` with a custom `render` attribute that specifies a graph node with specific properties, and then pass that instance to an instance of `EachColumn` to create a panel with the desired rendering. 

Here is an example of how these classes could be used:

```
# create an instance of EachColumnConfig with a custom render attribute
custom_render = graph.Node(label="Custom Node", color="blue")
config = EachColumnConfig(layoutMode="horizontal", render=custom_render)

# create an instance of EachColumn with the custom config
each_column = EachColumn(config=config)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `EachColumn` class?
- The `EachColumn` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and represents a panel that displays a single column of data.

2. What is the `EachColumnConfig` class used for?
- The `EachColumnConfig` class is a generic class that defines the configuration options for an `EachColumn` panel, including the layout mode, panel bank layout configuration, and the type of data to be rendered.

3. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator used in these classes?
- The `weave.type()` decorator is used to generate type annotations for the class attributes and methods, which can be used for type checking and documentation purposes.
