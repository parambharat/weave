The `weave` module provides a way to create and manipulate data flow graphs. This particular file defines two classes, `EachConfig` and `Each`, which are used to create a panel that can be used in a larger project.

The `EachConfig` class defines the configuration for an `Each` panel. It has two attributes: `pbConfig`, which is an instance of `PanelBankSectionConfig` and `panel`, which is an instance of `PanelType`. `PanelBankSectionConfig` is a class that defines the configuration for a panel bank section, and `PanelType` is a type variable that represents the type of panel that can be used in the `Each` panel.

The `Each` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and represents an `Each` panel. It has three attributes: `id`, `input_node`, and `config`. `id` is a string that represents the ID of the panel, `input_node` is a node that represents the input to the panel, and `config` is an instance of `EachConfig` that represents the configuration for the panel.

The `Each` class also has a method called `item_var` that returns a `VarNode` instance representing the item being processed by the panel. The `__init__` method of the `Each` class initializes the panel with the given input node, variables, and configuration. If no configuration is provided, it creates a default configuration with a `panel` attribute that is set to the `item_var` method.

Overall, this code provides a way to create an `Each` panel that can be used in a larger project. The `Each` panel processes each item in a list and applies a set of operations to each item. The `EachConfig` class provides a way to configure the panel, and the `Each` class provides the implementation of the panel. Here is an example of how the `Each` panel can be used:

```
input_node = graph.Node(list[int])
each_panel = Each(input_node)
output_node = each_panel.output_node
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Each` class and how is it used?
- The `Each` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and is used to iterate over a list of input data and apply a panel to each item in the list.

2. What is the `EachConfig` class and what does it contain?
- The `EachConfig` class is a dataclass that contains configuration options for the `Each` class, including a `PanelBankSectionConfig` object and a `PanelType` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `item_var` method in the `Each` class?
- The `item_var` method returns a `VarNode` object that represents the current item being processed by the `Each` class. This is used to dynamically create a panel for each item in the input list.
