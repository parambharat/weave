The code defines two classes, `FunctionEditorConfig` and `FunctionEditor`, both of which are part of the larger `weave` project. 

`FunctionEditorConfig` is a generic class that takes in a type parameter `ExpressionType`. It is decorated with the `weave.type()` decorator, which likely adds functionality to the class related to the `weave` project. The class has one attribute, `expr`, which is a `graph.Node` object with a default value of `graph.VoidNode`. This suggests that `FunctionEditorConfig` is used to store configuration information related to a function editor, specifically an expression node in a graph. 

`FunctionEditor` is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and has an `id` attribute set to `"FunctionEditor"`. It also has a `config` attribute, which is an instance of `FunctionEditorConfig`. The `config` attribute has a default value of an instance of `FunctionEditorConfig`. This suggests that `FunctionEditor` is a panel component that can be used in the larger `weave` project to display and edit function information. 

Overall, this code defines two classes that are likely used in the larger `weave` project to store and display function information. The `FunctionEditor` class is a panel component that can be used to display and edit function information, while the `FunctionEditorConfig` class is used to store configuration information related to a function editor. 

Example usage:

```
# create a new FunctionEditorConfig object with a graph node
node = graph.Node[int](5)
config = FunctionEditorConfig[int](expr=node)

# create a new FunctionEditor panel with the config object
editor = FunctionEditor(config=config)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator used in this code?
   - The `weave.type()` decorator is used to create a type that can be used with the `weave` library's dataflow graph.

2. What is the `FunctionEditor` class inheriting from?
   - The `FunctionEditor` class is inheriting from the `panel.Panel` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `FunctionEditorConfig` class and its `expr` attribute?
   - The `FunctionEditorConfig` class is a generic class used to configure the `FunctionEditor` class. Its `expr` attribute is a `graph.Node` object that represents an expression to be edited by the `FunctionEditor`.
