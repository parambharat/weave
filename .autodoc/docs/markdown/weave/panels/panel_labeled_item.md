The `weave` module provides a set of tools for building interactive web-based visualizations of data. The code in this file defines two classes: `LabeledItemConfig` and `LabeledItem`. 

`LabeledItemConfig` is a generic class that defines a labeled item. It has two attributes: `label` and `item`. `label` is a string that represents the label of the item, while `item` is a generic type that represents the item itself. The default value of `label` is an empty string, and the default value of `item` is a `VoidNode` object from the `graph` module. 

`LabeledItem` is a subclass of `Panel` from the `panel` module. It has an `id` attribute set to "LabeledItem", and a `config` attribute that is an instance of `LabeledItemConfig`. The `__init__` method of `LabeledItem` takes an `input_node`, `vars`, `config`, and `options` as arguments. It initializes the `Panel` superclass with `input_node` and `vars`, and then sets the `config` attribute to the value of `config` if it is not `None`, otherwise it creates a new `LabeledItemConfig` object with the `label` and `item` values from `options`. 

This code can be used to create labeled items in a web-based visualization. For example, if we want to create a labeled item with the label "Temperature" and the value 25, we can do the following:

```
from weave import LabeledItem, LabeledItemConfig

config = LabeledItemConfig(label="Temperature", item=25)
labeled_item = LabeledItem(config=config)
```

This will create a new `LabeledItem` object with the label "Temperature" and the value 25. We can then add this object to our visualization using the `add` method of a `Layout` object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LabeledItem` class and how is it used?
- The `LabeledItem` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and is used to create a labeled item with a specified label and item. It can be instantiated with an input node, variables, and options.

2. What is the `LabeledItemConfig` class and how does it relate to `LabeledItem`?
- The `LabeledItemConfig` class is a generic class that defines the configuration options for a `LabeledItem`. It includes a label and an item of a specified type. `LabeledItem` has an optional `config` attribute that can be set to an instance of `LabeledItemConfig`.

3. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator used on `LabeledItemConfig` and `LabeledItem`?
- The `weave.type()` decorator is used to indicate that the classes are "weavable", meaning that they can be used with the `weave` library to create a dataflow graph. This allows instances of `LabeledItem` to be connected to other nodes in a dataflow graph.
