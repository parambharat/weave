The `weave` project is a Python library for building interactive data visualizations. The code provided is a module within the `weave` project that defines a `Table` class and related functions for working with tables of data.

The `Table` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and `codifiable_value_mixin.CodifiableValueMixin`. It takes an input node and an optional configuration object as arguments. The configuration object is an instance of the `TableConfig` class, which defines various properties of the table, such as the row size, pinned rows, and active row for grouping.

The `Table` class has several methods for manipulating the table data, such as `add_column` for adding a new column to the table, and `get_final_named_select_functions` for getting the final named select functions for the table.

The module also defines several functions for working with the table data, such as `_get_rows_node` for getting the rows of the table, `_get_pinned_node` for getting the pinned rows of the table, and `_get_active_node` for getting the active row of the table.

The module also defines several `weave.op` functions for refining the output types of the table data, such as `rows` for getting all the rows of the table, `pinned_data` for getting the pinned data of the table, and `active_data` for getting the active data of the table.

Overall, this module provides a set of tools for working with tables of data in the `weave` project. It allows users to manipulate the data, get specific rows or columns, and refine the output types of the data for use in other parts of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Table` class and how is it used?
   
   The `Table` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and `codifiable_value_mixin.CodifiableValueMixin` that represents a table panel in the Weave data visualization platform. It takes an input node, variables, and configuration options as arguments and generates a table panel based on those inputs. It also provides methods for adding columns to the table and getting the final named select functions for the table. 

2. How does the `rows` function work and what does it return?
   
   The `rows` function is a Weave operation that takes a `Table` object as input and returns a list of rows for the table. It does this by applying filters, grouping, selection, and sorting to the input data node based on the configuration options for the table. The output type is a list of typed dictionaries representing the rows of the table.

3. What is the purpose of the `_get_pinned_node` function and how is it used?
   
   The `_get_pinned_node` function is a helper function used by the `pinned_data` and `pinned_rows` operations to generate a node representing the pinned rows of the table. It takes a `Table` or `Query` object and a data or rows node as input and returns a node representing the pinned rows of the table based on the configuration options for the table. The output type is a list of typed dictionaries representing the pinned rows of the table.
