This file contains utility functions for constructing GQL ops that are used by all the ops in `ops_domain`. There are four functions in this file:

- `gql_prop_op`: used for getting properties of GQL objects
- `gql_root_op`: used to start a query (much match to a query on the `Query` type)
- `gql_direct_edge_op`: used to get a direct edge of a GQL object leading to another GQL object
- `gql_connection_op`: used to get a connection of GQL objects (the standard edges/nodes pattern)

All but the `gql_prop_op` have the ability to specify additional inputs and how to map such inputs to a query param string. Each of these functions leverages the underlying `wb_gql_op_plugin` to create an op. You are always free to directly use `wb_gql_op_plugin` if you need to write custom logic - these are just wrappers since these cases are so common.

The `gql_prop_op` function is used for getting properties of GQL objects. It takes four arguments: `op_name`, `input_type`, `prop_name`, and `output_type`. It returns an op that can be used to get the value of a property of a GQL object. The `gql_root_op` function is used to start a query. It takes five arguments: `op_name`, `prop_name`, `output_type`, `additional_inputs_types`, and `param_str_fn`. It returns an op that can be used to start a query. The `gql_direct_edge_op` function is used to get a direct edge of a GQL object leading to another GQL object. It takes seven arguments: `op_name`, `input_type`, `prop_name`, `output_type`, `additional_inputs_types`, `param_str_fn`, and `is_many`. It returns an op that can be used to get a direct edge of a GQL object leading to another GQL object. The `gql_connection_op` function is used to get a connection of GQL objects. It takes six arguments: `op_name`, `input_type`, `prop_name`, `output_type`, `additional_inputs_types`, and `param_str_fn`. It returns an op that can be used to get a connection of GQL objects.

Please see `project_ops.py` for examples of all the above cases.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this file and what functions does it contain?
- This file contains utilities for constructing GQL ops used by all the ops in `ops_domain`. There are four functions: `gql_prop_op`, `gql_root_op`, `gql_direct_edge_op`, and `gql_connection_op`.

2. What is the purpose of the `_make_alias` function?
- The `_make_alias` function generates a unique alias for a given set of input arguments. It is used to create unique aliases for GQL queries.

3. What is the purpose of the `gql_connection_op` function?
- The `gql_connection_op` function is used to get a connection of GQL objects in the standard edges/nodes pattern. It takes in an input GQL object, a property name, and an output type, and returns a list of output objects.
