This code file imports various modules from the `weave` project and defines several operations that can be used to query and manipulate data related to artifact types and collections. 

The code is organized into six sections, each of which corresponds to a different type of operation. 

The first section, "Tag Getters," is empty and does not define any operations. 

The second section, "Root Ops," is also empty and does not define any operations. 

The third section, "Attribute Getters," defines a single operation called `op_artifact_type_name`. This operation takes an `ArtifactType` object as input and returns the name of the artifact type as a string. 

The fourth section, "Direct Relationship Ops," is empty and does not define any operations. 

The fifth section, "Connection Ops," defines a single operation called `gql_connection_op`. This operation is used to define a connection between two types of objects. In this case, the connection is between `ArtifactType` objects and `ArtifactCollection` objects. The operation takes several arguments, including the names of the types being connected, the names of the fields that define the connection, and a dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the GraphQL query. 

The sixth and final section, "Non Standard Business Logic Ops," defines an operation called `artifact_versions`. This operation takes an `ArtifactType` object as input and returns a list of `ArtifactVersion` objects. The operation uses a custom GraphQL query that retrieves the first 100 artifact collections of the specified type, and for each collection, retrieves the first 100 artifacts and their associated versions. The resulting `ArtifactVersion` objects are then returned as a list. 

Overall, this code file provides a set of operations that can be used to query and manipulate data related to artifact types and collections in the `weave` project. For example, the `op_artifact_type_name` operation could be used to retrieve the name of a specific artifact type, while the `artifact_versions` operation could be used to retrieve all versions of a specific artifact type.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- This code is part of the `weave` project, but it is unclear what the project does or what problem it solves.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `artifact_versions` function?
- The `artifact_versions` function takes an input of type `wdt.ArtifactType` and returns a list of `wdt.ArtifactVersion` objects.

3. Why is the `first_100_collections_alias` op considered "horrible" and what is the suggested solution?
- The `first_100_collections_alias` op is considered "horrible" due to the double limits, and the suggested solution is to remove it. However, it is unclear what this op does or why it is necessary.
