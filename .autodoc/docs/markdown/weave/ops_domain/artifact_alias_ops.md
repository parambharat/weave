This code is a part of the weave project and is responsible for defining GraphQL operations for the WandB domain. The code imports various modules from the project and defines GraphQL operations for different sections of the domain.

The code is divided into six sections, each responsible for defining a specific type of GraphQL operation. The first section, "Tag Getters," is currently empty and does not define any operations. The second section, "Root Ops," is also empty and does not define any operations.

The third section, "Attribute Getters," defines a single GraphQL operation called "artifactAlias-alias." This operation retrieves the "alias" attribute of an "ArtifactAliasType" object and returns it as a string.

The fourth section, "Direct Relationship Ops," defines a GraphQL operation called "artifactAlias-artifact." This operation retrieves the "artifactCollection" attribute of an "ArtifactAliasType" object and returns it as an "ArtifactCollectionType" object.

The fifth section, "Connection Ops," is currently empty and does not define any operations. The sixth section, "Non Standard Business Logic Ops," is also empty and does not define any operations.

Overall, this code is an important part of the weave project as it defines the GraphQL operations that can be used to interact with the WandB domain. These operations can be used by other parts of the project to retrieve and manipulate data within the domain. For example, the "artifactAlias-alias" operation could be used to retrieve the alias of an artifact, while the "artifactAlias-artifact" operation could be used to retrieve the artifact collection associated with an artifact alias.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?
- This file is importing modules from `weave.compile_domain`, `weave.api`, `weave.weave_types`, and `weave.wandb_domain_gql`, so a smart developer might want to know what each of these modules do and how they contribute to the overall purpose of the `weave` project.

2. What do the `gql_prop_op` and `gql_direct_edge_op` functions do?
- These functions are creating GraphQL operations for retrieving data from the `wdt.ArtifactAliasType` and `wdt.ArtifactCollectionType` types, respectively. A smart developer might want to know more about the parameters being passed to these functions and how they relate to the GraphQL schema being used in the `weave` project.

3. Why are there empty sections labeled "Tag Getters", "Root Ops", "Connection Ops", and "Non Standard Business Logic Ops"?
- A smart developer might wonder if these sections are placeholders for future code that hasn't been written yet, or if they are intentionally left empty because they are not needed for this particular file. They might also want to know if there are plans to add code to these sections in the future.
