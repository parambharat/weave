This file contains the implementation of the "W&B Domain Types" for the Weave project. The purpose of this file is to define the types that correspond to the types/interfaces in the WB GQL schema. The types are defined using the `weave_type` decorator, which sets the Weave type to be a plain string called "user". Each type follows the same pattern for declaration, which includes setting the `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` to specify the minimum GQL fragment that should be used when loading this type from GQL. The data is currently stored in `User.gql`, which gets serialized as an untyped string but can be accessed like a dictionary.

The `UntypedOpaqueDict` class is a Weave Type that is used to store arbitrary JSON data. Unlike `Dict` or `TypedDict`, this Type does not need to define the keys/fields. This is useful in particular for storing GQL responses where the response schema may change over time. The class provides two methods for creating an instance of the class: `from_json_dict` and `from_dict`. The former creates an instance from a JSON dictionary, while the latter creates an instance from a regular dictionary. The data is serialized as a JSON string, so it can be stored and loaded using the Weave Type system.

The other classes defined in this file are `Org`, `Entity`, `User`, `Project`, `Run`, `ArtifactType`, `ArtifactCollection`, `ArtifactVersion`, `ArtifactCollectionMembership`, `ArtifactAlias`, `Report`, and `RunQueue`. Each of these classes is a subclass of `GQLTypeMixin`, which provides a `gql` attribute that is an instance of `UntypedOpaqueDict`. The `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` attribute is set for each class to specify the minimum GQL fragment that should be used when loading the corresponding type from GQL. 

Overall, this file provides the necessary types for the Weave project to interact with the WB GQL schema. The `UntypedOpaqueDict` class is particularly useful for storing arbitrary JSON data, which is common in GQL responses where the response schema may change over time. The other classes provide a way to interact with the specific types defined in the WB GQL schema.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_type` decorator and how is it used in this code?
   - The `weave_type` decorator is used to define a Weave type for a class and specify its corresponding type/interface in the WB GQL schema. It takes in two arguments: the name of the Weave type and a boolean indicating whether the type is a plain string. It is used to define various domain types in this code, such as `Org`, `Entity`, `User`, etc.
2. What is the purpose of the `UntypedOpaqueDict` class and how is it used in this code?
   - The `UntypedOpaqueDict` class is a Weave type that is used to store arbitrary JSON data. It is useful for storing GQL responses where the response schema may change over time. It can be instantiated from a JSON string or a dictionary, and it serializes the data as a JSON string so it can be stored and loaded using the Weave Type system. It is used as a field in the `GQLTypeMixin` class and its subclasses to store GQL data.
3. What is the purpose of the `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` attribute in the `GQLTypeMixin` class and its subclasses?
   - The `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` attribute is used to specify the minimum GQL fragment that should be used when loading a particular type from GQL. It is used in the `from_gql` classmethod of the `GQLTypeMixin` class and its subclasses to create an instance of the class from a GQL dictionary. It specifies the fields that are required for the class to function properly.
