This code defines a set of operations for generating reports on various metrics related to the usage of a product called Weave. The reports are generated using GraphQL queries and are intended to provide insights into how the product is being used by customers. 

The `make_rpt_op` function is the main function that generates the report operations. It takes two arguments: `plot_name` and `output_row_type`. `plot_name` is a string that specifies the name of the report, and `output_row_type` is a dictionary that specifies the schema of the report data. The function generates a new operation for each report, with the name `rpt_{plot_name}`. 

Each report operation takes a `repoName` argument and returns a dictionary with two keys: `rows` and `isNormalizedUserCount`. `rows` is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row of data in the report. The keys of the dictionary correspond to the columns of the report, and the values are the data for each row. `isNormalizedUserCount` is a boolean value that indicates whether the user counts in the report have been normalized. 

The `normalize_user_counts` function is another operation that can be used to normalize the user counts in a report. It takes a list of dictionaries as input, where each dictionary represents a row of data in the report. The function calculates a normalization factor based on the user counts in the earliest week of data, and then normalizes the user counts in all subsequent weeks. The function returns the normalized data as a list of dictionaries. 

Overall, this code provides a framework for generating reports on various metrics related to the usage of Weave. The reports can be customized by specifying the name of the report and the schema of the report data. The `normalize_user_counts` function can be used to normalize the user counts in the reports, which can be useful for comparing usage across different time periods.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` and `errors` modules?
- The `weave_types` module defines custom type annotations used throughout the code, while the `errors` module defines custom error classes.

2. What is the purpose of the `make_rpt_op` function?
- The `make_rpt_op` function generates a Weave operation for a given plot name and output row type, which is used to query data from a GraphQL API.

3. What is the purpose of the `normalize_user_counts` function?
- The `normalize_user_counts` function takes in a list of dictionaries representing user counts over time and a boolean indicating whether to normalize the counts, and returns the same list with the counts normalized if requested.
