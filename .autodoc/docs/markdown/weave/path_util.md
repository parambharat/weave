The `safe_join` function in the `weave` project is designed to safely join multiple paths together. It takes in a variable number of arguments, which can be either strings or `pathlib.Path` objects. The function then joins these arguments together to create a new path.

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the resulting path is relative to the first directory provided. This is important for security reasons, as it prevents users from accessing files outside of the intended directory structure.

To achieve this, the function first converts the first argument to a `pathlib.Path` object. It then uses the `joinpath` method to join this path with the remaining arguments. Finally, it checks that the resulting path is relative to the first path by resolving both paths and checking if the result is a subpath of the first path. If the resulting path is not relative to the first path, the function raises a `WeaveAccessDeniedError`.

Here is an example of how this function might be used in the larger `weave` project:

```python
import weave

# Define some paths
root_dir = "/path/to/root"
sub_dir = "subdirectory"
file_name = "file.txt"

# Join the paths together using safe_join
joined_path = weave.safe_join(root_dir, sub_dir, file_name)

# Use the resulting path to access a file
with open(joined_path, "r") as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

In this example, `safe_join` is used to join together a root directory, a subdirectory, and a file name. The resulting path is then used to open a file and read its contents. By using `safe_join`, we can ensure that the file being accessed is within the intended directory structure and prevent users from accessing files outside of this structure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `safe_join` function?
- The `safe_join` function joins multiple paths together and ensures that the resulting path is relative to the first path provided.

2. What is the input and output of the `safe_join` function?
- The input of the `safe_join` function is a variable number of strings or `pathlib.Path` objects. The output of the function is a string representing the joined path.

3. What happens if the resulting path is not relative to the first path provided?
- If the resulting path is not relative to the first path provided, the function raises a `WeaveAccessDeniedError` from the `errors` module.
