The `weave` project includes a file that defines a class called `SlackReadExportApi` and a function called `dirsize`. The purpose of this code is to provide functionality for reading and processing data from a Slack export. 

The `dirsize` function takes a path as input and returns the total size of all files in that directory and its subdirectories. This function is used in the `SlackReadExportApi` class to calculate the size of a channel's export data.

The `SlackReadExportApi` class has a single attribute called `data_dir`, which is an instance of the `weave.Dir` class. This attribute represents the directory where the Slack export data is stored. 

The class has four methods. The `channel_names` method returns a generator that yields the names of all channels in the export data directory. The `channel_path` method takes a channel name as input and returns the path to that channel's data directory. The `channel_export_size` method takes a channel name as input and returns the size of that channel's export data. Finally, the `channel_messages` method takes a channel name as input and returns a list of all messages in that channel's export data. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to access and process data from a Slack export. For example, a user of the `weave` project could use this code to extract all messages from a specific channel in a Slack export and perform further analysis on that data. 

Example usage:

```
# create a SlackReadExportApi instance with the path to the export data directory
api = SlackReadExportApi(data_dir=weave.Dir("/path/to/slack/export/data"))

# get the names of all channels in the export data
channel_names = list(api.channel_names())

# get the path to a specific channel's data directory
channel_path = api.channel_path("general")

# get the size of a specific channel's export data
channel_size = api.channel_export_size("general")

# get all messages from a specific channel's export data
channel_messages = api.channel_messages("general")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator on the `SlackReadExportApi` class?
- The `weave.type()` decorator is likely used to indicate that the `SlackReadExportApi` class is a weave type, which may have implications for how it is used or accessed within the larger project.

2. What is the expected format of the data returned by the `channel_messages` method?
- The code includes a TODO comment indicating that the `channel_messages` method should return a dict in the slack export format, but it is not clear what that format is or what specific keys or values should be included.

3. How is the `dirsize` function used within the `SlackReadExportApi` class?
- The `dirsize` function is used within the `channel_export_size` method to calculate the total size of the files in a given channel's export directory. However, it is not clear how this value is ultimately used or what purpose it serves within the larger project.
