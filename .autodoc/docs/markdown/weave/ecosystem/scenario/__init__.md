The `weave` module is being imported and the `typing` module is also being imported. The `ScenarioResult` class is defined as a subclass of `typing.TypedDict`. It has a `scenario_id` attribute of type `str` and six `metric` attributes of type `float`. The `MetricsBankInput` class is also defined as a subclass of `typing.TypedDict`. It has two attributes, `baseline` and `candidate`, both of which are lists of `ScenarioResult` objects. 

The `MetricsBankPanel` class is defined as a subclass of `weave.Panel`. It has an `id` attribute set to `"MetricsBankPanel"` and an `input_node` attribute of type `weave.Node[MetricsBankInput]`. The `render` method is decorated with `weave.op()`. It takes no arguments and returns a `weave.panels.Each` object. 

Inside the `render` method, the `input_node` attribute is cast to type `MetricsBankInput`. The `baseline` and `candidate` attributes of the `MetricsBankInput` object are assigned to `baseline` and `candidate` variables, respectively. The `weave.ops.join_all()` method is called with two arguments: a `weave.ops.make_list()` object and a lambda function. The `make_list()` object takes two lists, `baseline` and `candidate`, and returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has keys `"scenario_id"`, `"metric1"`, `"metric2"`, `"metric3"`, `"metric4"`, `"metric5"`, and `"metric6"`. The lambda function takes a row from the list of dictionaries and returns the value of the `"scenario_id"` key. The `join_all()` method returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary has keys `"scenario_id"`, `"metric1"`, `"metric2"`, `"metric3"`, `"metric4"`, `"metric5"`, and `"metric6"`, and values that are tuples of the corresponding values from the `baseline` and `candidate` lists. 

The `weave.ops.difference()` method is called with two arguments: the keys of the first dictionary in the `joined` list and a list containing the string `"scenario_id"`. The `difference()` method returns a list of strings that are the keys of the `joined` dictionaries, except for `"scenario_id"`. 

Finally, a `weave.panels.Each` object is returned. It takes two arguments: the list of metric names returned by `weave.ops.difference()` and a lambda function that returns a `weave.panels.Group` object. The `Group` object has two keys: `"title"`, which is the metric name, and `"plot"`, which is a `weave.panels.Plot` object. The `Plot` object takes two arguments: the `joined` list and two lambda functions that return the values of the `"metric_name"` key for the baseline and candidate dictionaries, respectively. 

Overall, this code defines a `MetricsBankPanel` class that takes two lists of `ScenarioResult` objects and returns a `weave.panels.Each` object that contains a `weave.panels.Group` object for each metric in the `ScenarioResult` objects. Each `Group` object contains a `weave.panels.Plot` object that plots the values of the metric for the baseline and candidate dictionaries.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ScenarioResult` and `MetricsBankInput` classes?
    
    `ScenarioResult` is a typed dictionary that defines the structure of a scenario result, including its ID and six metrics. `MetricsBankInput` is another typed dictionary that defines the structure of the input to the `MetricsBankPanel`, which includes a baseline and candidate list of `ScenarioResult` objects.

2. What is the `MetricsBankPanel` class and what does it do?
    
    `MetricsBankPanel` is a subclass of `weave.Panel` that takes in a `MetricsBankInput` object and produces a panel with plots for each metric in the input. It first joins the baseline and candidate lists on the scenario ID, then computes the metrics to plot by taking the difference of the joined keys and the scenario ID. Finally, it creates a plot for each metric using the joined data and adds it to the panel.

3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comments in the `render` method?
    
    The first `TODO` comment indicates that there used to be a `title` parameter for the `Plot` object that was removed, and suggests that it should be added back. The second `TODO` comment indicates that there used to be `x_title` and `y_title` parameters for the `Plot` object that were removed, and suggests that they should be added back.
