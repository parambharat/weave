The code above is importing the `context_state` module from the `weave` project and setting a variable `_loading_builtins_token` to the result of calling the `set_loading_built_ins()` method from the `context_state` module. 

Next, the code is importing the `spacy` module from the current directory using a relative import. 

Finally, the code is calling the `clear_loading_built_ins()` method from the `context_state` module with the `_loading_builtins_token` variable as an argument. This method clears the built-in modules that were loaded during the import of the `spacy` module, which allows for a clean import of the module.

Overall, this code is used to import the `spacy` module in a way that ensures that the built-in modules are not loaded during the import process. This is important because it can prevent conflicts with other modules that may be using the same built-in modules. 

An example of how this code may be used in the larger project is in a natural language processing (NLP) application that uses the `spacy` module to analyze text. By importing the module in this way, the application can ensure that the built-in modules are not loaded in a way that could cause conflicts with other parts of the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave.context_state` module and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `weave.context_state` module is being imported as `_context` and is used to set and clear a token for loading built-in modules.
2. What is the significance of the `from .spacy import *` statement?
   - This statement is importing all modules from the `spacy` package located in the same directory as the current file.
3. Why is the `clear_loading_built_ins()` method being called after setting the loading built-ins token?
   - This method is being called to clear the token and allow for normal loading of built-in modules.
