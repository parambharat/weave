The `weave` project includes a function called `histogram` that generates a composite histogram from one or more series of float values provided, using the same bins. The function takes in a list of lists of float values, a bin size, a chart title, and a list of series names. It returns a static image of the resulting histogram.

The function first computes the range of values across all series and generates bins across the full value range, where each bin has size `bin_size`. It then iterates over each series and plots a histogram of the values using the same bins. The function uses different colors for each series and includes a legend to label each series. The resulting image is saved as a PNG file and returned as a PIL Image object.

The `histogram` function can be used in the larger project to visualize the distribution of values across multiple series. For example, it could be used to compare the performance of different machine learning models on a particular task by plotting the distribution of their accuracy scores. The resulting histogram could help identify which model(s) perform better or worse on the task. 

Here is an example usage of the `histogram` function:

```python
import random

# generate some random data for two series
series1 = [random.uniform(0, 10) for _ in range(100)]
series2 = [random.uniform(0, 10) for _ in range(100)]

# plot a composite histogram of the two series
hist = histogram([series1, series2], bin_size=0.5, chart_title="My Histogram", series_names=["Series 1", "Series 2"])

# display the resulting image
hist.show()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave.op` decorator on the `histogram` function?
- The `weave.op` decorator is used to indicate that the `histogram` function is an operation that can be executed by the `weave` library.

2. What is the expected input format for the `val_series` parameter of the `histogram` function?
- The `val_series` parameter is expected to be a list of lists, where each inner list contains float values to be plotted on the histogram.

3. What is the purpose of the `render_info` parameter in the `weave.op` decorator?
- The `render_info` parameter is used to provide metadata about the operation, such as the type of function it is. This metadata can be used by other parts of the `weave` library to display information about the operation.
