The `shawn` folder in the `weave` project contains several modules that provide functionality for model evaluation, dataset handling, and basic operations. These modules can be used together or independently within the larger project.

The `eval.py` module provides a framework for running models, generating predictions, and evaluating models based on their predictions. It defines classes like `Prediction`, `EvalModel`, `PredictionProcess`, and `Predictor`. For example, to get all predictions made by a model within a specific time window:

```python
model = EvalModel("my_model")
start_time = datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)
end_time = datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0)
predictions = model.all_predictions(start_time, end_time)
print(predictions)
```

The `petdataset.py` module provides functionality for loading the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset and displaying it in a table using the `PetDatasetPanel` class. Here's an example of how to load the dataset and display it in a table:

```python
import weave

from weave.contrib.datasets import petdataset
from weave.contrib.panels import PetDatasetPanel

pipeline = weave.Pipeline()
items = petdataset("/path/to/dataset")
input_node = pipeline.add_node(items)
panel = PetDatasetPanel(input_node)
pipeline.add_panel(panel)
pipeline.run()
```

The `scratch.py` module defines operations and a configuration class for basic operations like addition. It provides the `single_distribution` operation for creating histograms, the `AdderConfig` class for configuring an adder panel, and the `Adder` class for creating an adder panel with a configurable `operand` field.

In summary, the `shawn` folder contains modules that can be used in various parts of the `weave` project for tasks like model evaluation, dataset handling, and basic operations. These modules can be imported and used as needed, providing flexibility and modularity to the larger project.
