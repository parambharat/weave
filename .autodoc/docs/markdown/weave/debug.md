The `weave` project includes a file that contains a function called `trace`. This function is a decorator that can be used to trace recursive function calls. The purpose of this function is to aid in debugging by providing information about the function calls and their results.

The `trace` function takes a single argument, which is a callable object. This object can be any function or method that takes arguments and returns a value. The function returns a new callable object that wraps the original function and adds tracing functionality.

When the decorated function is called, the `trace` function prints information about the call, including the name of the function, the arguments passed to it, and the keyword arguments passed to it. It also prints the result of the function call. The output is indented based on the level of recursion, so that it is easy to see which calls are nested within others.

Here is an example of how the `trace` function can be used:

```
@trace
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```

When this code is run, it will print out information about each call to the `factorial` function, including the arguments passed and the result of each call. This can be useful for understanding how the function works and for identifying any errors that may be present.

Overall, the `trace` function is a useful tool for debugging recursive functions in the `weave` project. By providing detailed information about function calls and their results, it can help developers to identify and fix errors more quickly and easily.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `trace` function?
- The `trace` function is a decorator used for tracing recursive function calls.

2. What is the input and output of the `trace` function?
- The `trace` function takes in a callable function as input and returns a callable function as output.

3. What does the `ctx` variable represent in the `trace` function?
- The `ctx` variable is a dictionary used to store the current level of recursion in the traced function.
