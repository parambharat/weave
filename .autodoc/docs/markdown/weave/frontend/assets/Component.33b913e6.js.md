This code is part of a larger project and primarily focuses on rendering tags and aliases for various elements in a user interface. The code is organized into several components and utility functions that work together to achieve this functionality.

The `reactUtils.ts` file provides utility functions for handling React component props. The `pickNameProps` function takes an object and returns a new object containing only the `className` and `id` properties.

The `Text.tsx` file defines a `SingleLineText` component that renders text with optional `maxWidth` and `alignSelf` properties. If the `maxWidth` property is provided, the text will overflow with no line wrap and ellipsis.

The `Tags.styles.ts` file defines styled components for icons, including different sizes and positions.

The `Tags.tsx` file defines two main components: `Tag` and `Tags`. The `Tag` component renders a single tag with a specific size, type, and optional delete functionality. The `Tags` component renders a collection of tags, allowing for optional deletion and click handling.

The `Component.tsx` file defines a `PanelArtifactVersionAliases` component that fetches and displays a list of artifact version aliases as tags. It uses the `Tag` component from the `Tags.tsx` file to render each alias.

Here's an example of how the `Tags` component can be used:

```javascript
import { Tags } from './Tags.tsx';

const tagsData = [
  { name: 'tag1', colorIndex: 0 },
  { name: 'tag2', colorIndex: 1 },
];

function handleDelete(tag) {
  console.log('Deleted tag:', tag.name);
}

function handleClick(tagName) {
  console.log('Clicked tag:', tagName);
}

<Tags
  size="medium"
  tags={tagsData}
  enableDelete
  noun="tag"
  deleteTag={handleDelete}
  onClick={handleClick}
/>
```

This example renders a `Tags` component with two tags, allowing for deletion and click handling.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `pickNameProps` function in the `reactUtils.ts` file?**

   The `pickNameProps` function is used to extract the `className` and `id` properties from a given object (props) and return a new object containing only these properties. This is useful for passing through common props in React components.

2. **How does the `SingleLineText` component handle text overflow and line wrapping?**

   The `SingleLineText` component handles text overflow by setting the `maxWidth` property in its style object. If the `maxWidth` prop is provided, the text will overflow with no line wrap and display an ellipsis. Otherwise, it will not have any specific width constraint.

3. **What is the purpose of the `nounToTagType` function in the `Tags.tsx` file?**

   The `nounToTagType` function is used to convert a given noun (a string representing the type of tag) to a `TagType` enum value. This is useful for determining the appropriate styling and behavior for different types of tags (e.g., regular tags, aliases, or protected aliases).
