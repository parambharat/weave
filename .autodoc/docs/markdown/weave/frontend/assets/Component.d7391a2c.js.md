The code in this file defines a React component called `PanelFileText` that is used to display the contents of a file in a panel. The component takes in a `fileNode` as input, which is an object that represents the file and contains information such as its name and type. The component first checks the size of the file and if it exceeds a certain limit, it displays a warning message instead of the file contents.

If the file size is within the limit, the component fetches the contents of the file using the `Op.opFileContents` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library. The contents are then processed using the `processTextForDisplay` function to limit the number of lines and characters per line, and to format the text for display. The processed results are then displayed in a `pre` element with syntax highlighting using the `Prism` library.

The component also displays warning messages if any lines or the total number of lines in the file were truncated due to the limits set by `LINE_LENGTH_LIMIT` and `TOTAL_LINES_LIMIT`. The language of the file is determined based on its extension using the `languageFromFileName` function.

Overall, this component provides a convenient way to display the contents of a file in a panel with syntax highlighting and limits on the number of lines and characters per line. It can be used in a larger project that involves displaying and manipulating files, such as a code editor or a data analysis tool. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import PanelFileText from 'weave/Component';

const fileNode = { name: 'example.txt', type: { extension: 'txt' } };
// ... fetch file contents and pass them as input to PanelFileText ...

<PanelFileText input={fileNode} />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
   - This code file defines a React component called `PanelFileText` that renders the contents of a file in a panel. It also includes some limits on the size and length of the file that can be displayed.
2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   - This code uses several external libraries, including `@wandb/weave/core`, `numeral`, `prismjs`, and `semantic-ui-react`.
3. What is the purpose of the `processTextForDisplay` function?
   - The `processTextForDisplay` function takes in the contents of a file and some limits on the length and number of lines, and returns a processed version of the text that fits within those limits. This processed text is then displayed in the panel.
