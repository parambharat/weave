The `weave` module provides functionality for defining and executing operations in a data processing pipeline. The code in this file defines a custom type `OpDefType` that extends the `Type` class from the `weave_types` module. This custom type is used to serialize and deserialize `OpDef` objects, which represent operations in the pipeline.

The `OpDefType` class defines two methods: `save_instance` and `load_instance`. The `save_instance` method takes an `OpDef` object, serializes it, and saves it to an artifact. If the `OpDef` object is a built-in operation, the method saves a JSON file with the operation's name. Otherwise, the method generates Python code for the operation's implementation, including any necessary imports and type annotations, and saves it to a `.py` file.

The `load_instance` method loads an `OpDef` object from an artifact. If the object is a built-in operation, the method loads the operation's name from a JSON file and retrieves the corresponding `OpDef` object from a registry. Otherwise, the method loads the Python code for the operation's implementation from a `.py` file, imports the module, and retrieves the `OpDef` object from the module.

The `type_code` function is a helper function that generates a string representation of a type, including any generic arguments. The `generate_referenced_type_code` function is another helper function that generates Python code for any referenced types in a function's type annotations. The `get_code_deps` function is a third helper function that extracts any necessary imports from a function's implementation code.

The `fully_qualified_opname` function is a utility function that generates a fully-qualified name for an operation, including the file path and function name. This function is used to register operations in the pipeline.

Overall, this code provides the functionality for serializing and deserializing `OpDef` objects, which are the building blocks of operations in the data processing pipeline. The `OpDefType` class is used to define a custom type that can handle the serialization and deserialization of these objects, and the helper functions provide additional functionality for generating Python code and extracting necessary imports.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `type_code` function?
    - The `type_code` function is used to generate a string representation of a given type, including any nested generic types.

2. What is the purpose of the `generate_referenced_type_code` function?
    - The `generate_referenced_type_code` function is used to generate non-redundant code that declares any referenced types and their referenced types and so on, given a function that may have type annotations.

3. What is the purpose of the `get_code_deps` function?
    - The `get_code_deps` function is used to pull in other functions and modules referenced in the function body, generating import statements for them. However, it is currently a proof-of-concept and not general, and may generate a lot of repetition.
