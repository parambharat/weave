This code is a part of the larger project called "weave". The purpose of this code is to import various modules and classes from the project and define two classes that inherit from the "Mapper" class. These classes are used to convert Python functions to JSON format and vice versa. 

The "FunctionToPyFunction" class has a single method called "apply" which takes an object as input and returns its JSON representation. The method checks if the input object is of the correct type and then calls the "to_json" method on it to get its JSON representation. 

The "PyFunctionToFunction" class also has a single method called "apply" which takes an object as input and returns its Python representation. The method checks if the input object is a string or a graph node and then converts it to the corresponding Python representation. 

Finally, the "add_mapper" method is called on the "mappers_python" module to register the two mapper classes for the "Function" type. This means that whenever a "Function" object needs to be converted to JSON or Python format, these mapper classes will be used. 

This code can be used in the larger project to facilitate the conversion of Python functions to JSON format and vice versa. This can be useful in scenarios where functions need to be serialized and sent over a network or stored in a database. 

Example usage:

```
# Define a Python function
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Convert the function to JSON format
json_function = FunctionToPyFunction().apply(add_numbers)

# Convert the JSON function back to Python format
python_function = PyFunctionToFunction().apply(json_function)

# Call the Python function
result = python_function(2, 3)
print(result) # Output: 5
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?
- The code is a part of the `weave` project, but it is not clear what the project does or what problem it solves.

2. What is the `FunctionToPyFunction` class doing?
- The `FunctionToPyFunction` class is a subclass of `mappers.Mapper` and has an `apply` method that converts an object to JSON format.

3. What is the `PyFunctionToFunction` class doing?
- The `PyFunctionToFunction` class is also a subclass of `mappers.Mapper` and has an `apply` method that converts an object from JSON format to either a `graph.Node` object or a `node_ref.Ref` object depending on the input type.
