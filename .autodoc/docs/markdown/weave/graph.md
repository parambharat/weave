The code defines a `Node` class hierarchy and related utility functions for representing and manipulating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of operations in the Weave project. The `Node` class is a generic base class for different types of nodes in the DAG, such as `OutputNode`, `VarNode`, `ConstNode`, and `VoidNode`. Each node type has specific attributes and methods for handling their respective roles in the DAG.

The `Op` class represents an operation in the DAG, with a name and a dictionary of input nodes. The `OutputNode` class represents the output of an operation, containing a reference to the `Op` object and the output type. The `VarNode` class represents a variable in the DAG, with a name and a type. The `ConstNode` class represents a constant value in the DAG, with a type and a value. The `VoidNode` class represents an invalid node with an invalid type.

The code also provides utility functions for working with nodes and DAGs, such as `nodes_equal`, `for_each`, `opuri_full_name`, `op_full_name`, `node_expr_str`, and various `map_nodes_*` and `filter_nodes_*` functions. These functions allow for comparing, iterating, transforming, and filtering nodes in the DAG.

For example, the `map_nodes_full` function can be used to apply a transformation function to all nodes in the DAG, including sub-lambdas, while the `filter_nodes_top_level` function can be used to filter nodes based on a predicate function, but only at the top level of the DAG.

Overall, this code provides the foundation for representing and manipulating DAGs of operations in the Weave project, enabling the construction and analysis of complex data processing pipelines.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Node` class and its subclasses (`OutputNode`, `VarNode`, `ConstNode`, and `VoidNode`)?

   **Answer:** The `Node` class is a generic class representing a node in a graph. Its subclasses represent different types of nodes in the graph: `OutputNode` represents a node with an operation and its inputs, `VarNode` represents a variable node, `ConstNode` represents a constant node, and `VoidNode` represents an invalid node.

2. **Question:** How does the `map_nodes_top_level` and `map_nodes_full` functions work, and what is the difference between them?

   **Answer:** Both `map_nodes_top_level` and `map_nodes_full` functions are used to apply a mapping function to nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented by leaf nodes. The difference between them is that `map_nodes_top_level` only applies the mapping function to the top-level nodes in the DAG, while `map_nodes_full` applies the mapping function to all nodes in the DAG, including sub-lambdas.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `linearize` function, and when would it be used?

   **Answer:** The `linearize` function is used to return a list of `OutputNode` instances by walking the 0th argument of the given node. It can be used when you want to linearize a graph by following the first input of each node, creating a list of nodes in the order they are connected.
