This file contains a single exported function called `process_opdef_resolve_fn`. The purpose of this function is to post-process the result of an op_def's resolve_fn. The function takes in an op_def, a resolve_fn, a list of arguments, and a dictionary of keyword arguments. 

The `propagate_arrow_tags` function is called within `process_opdef_resolve_fn` and is responsible for stripping tags from each element of an arrow weave list and creating a new arrow weave list that contains just the untagged values. The function then passes that to the op resolver. Once the result is returned, the function re-applies the tags that were stripped previously.

The `flow_tags` function is also called within `process_opdef_resolve_fn` and is responsible for flowing tags from the input to the output. If the first input is tagged, the function will add the same tags to the output. If the output is a type, the function will create a `TaggedValueType` object with the tag type and output type. If the output is not a type, the function will add the tags to the output using `tag_store.add_tags`.

Finally, `process_opdef_resolve_fn` is responsible for post-processing the results of a resolve_fn. Specifically, it will take one of three actions: 
1. If `_should_tag_op_def_outputs` is true, then it will tag the output with the input.
2. Else If `_should_flow_tags`, then it will flow the tags from the input to the output.
3. Else, it will just return the output.

This function is used in the larger project to handle the post-processing of op_def resolve_fn results. It allows for the stripping and re-application of tags and the flowing of tags from input to output. This function is important for maintaining consistency and accuracy in the project's data processing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `propagate_arrow_tags` function?
- The `propagate_arrow_tags` function is responsible for stripping tags from each element of an arrow weave list, passing the untagged values to the op resolver, and then re-applying the tags that were stripped previously.

2. What is the difference between tagging the output with the input and flowing tags from the input to the output?
- Tagging the output with the input means that the output will be tagged with the same tags as the input. Flowing tags from the input to the output means that the output will be tagged with any tags that were present on the input.

3. What is the purpose of the `process_opdef_resolve_fn` function?
- The `process_opdef_resolve_fn` function is responsible for post-processing the results of a resolve_fn. It will either tag the output with the input, flow tags from the input to the output, or return the output as is, depending on certain conditions.
