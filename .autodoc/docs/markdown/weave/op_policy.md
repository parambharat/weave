This file contains a cache policy for the weave project. The purpose of this code is to determine which operations should be cached and which should be run in parallel. 

The code defines two lists of operation names: CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES and CACHE_OP_NAMES. The operations in CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES are both cached and run in parallel, while the operations in CACHE_OP_NAMES are only cached. 

The code also defines a function called should_run_in_parallel, which takes an operation name as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation should be run in parallel. This function checks if the operation name is in the list of PARALLEL_OP_NAMES, which includes all operations in CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES. 

Similarly, the function should_cache takes an operation name as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation should be cached. This function checks if the operation name is in the list of CACHE_OP_NAMES. 

Finally, the function should_table_cache takes an operation name as input and always returns False. 

This code is used in the larger weave project to optimize performance by caching expensive operations and running parallel operations concurrently. For example, if an operation is known to be computationally expensive or require a lot of memory, it can be added to the CACHE_OP_NAMES list to ensure that it is cached and not recomputed unnecessarily. Similarly, if an operation can be run in parallel without causing conflicts, it can be added to the CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES list to take advantage of parallel processing. 

Example usage:

```
op_name = "op-expensive_op"
if should_cache(op_name):
    # retrieve cached result
else:
    # compute result and cache it
```

```
op_name = "Chain-run"
if should_run_in_parallel(op_name):
    # run operation in parallel
else:
    # run operation sequentially
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES` and `CACHE_OP_NAMES` lists?
   - These lists contain the names of operations that should be cached or run in parallel when cache mode is minimal.
2. What is the difference between `CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES` and `PARALLEL_OP_NAMES`?
   - `CACHE_AND_PARALLEL_OP_NAMES` contains the names of operations that should be both cached and run in parallel, while `PARALLEL_OP_NAMES` contains only the names of operations that should be run in parallel.
3. What is the purpose of the `should_table_cache` function?
   - This function always returns `False`, indicating that table caching is not supported in this implementation.
