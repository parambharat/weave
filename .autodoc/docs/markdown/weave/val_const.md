The `weave.const` module provides a way to wrap a Python value and encode it as a `Const` type in the Weave type system. This is achieved by calling the `weave.const()` function and passing in the value to be wrapped. The resulting object is an instance of the `Const` class defined in the module.

The purpose of this module is to allow for the creation of immutable values in the Weave type system. By wrapping a value in a `Const` object, the value cannot be modified or reassigned. This can be useful in situations where a value should not be changed, such as in configuration settings or constants used throughout a project.

The `Const` class has a single attribute, `val`, which stores the wrapped value. The `__init__()` method initializes the `val` attribute with the passed-in value.

The `types.Const.instance_classes` line sets the `Const` class as the instance class for the `ConstType` in the Weave type system. This allows the Weave type system to recognize and handle `Const` objects appropriately.

Here is an example of how to use the `weave.const` module:

```
import weave.const as const

# Wrap a string value in a Const object
my_const = const("hello")

# Attempt to modify the value (will raise an AttributeError)
my_const.val = "world"
```

In this example, `my_const` is a `Const` object wrapping the string value "hello". Attempting to modify the value by assigning a new value to the `val` attribute will raise an `AttributeError`, preventing the value from being changed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Const` class?
- The `Const` class is used to wrap a Python value and encode it as a `ConstType` in the Weave type system.

2. How is the `Const` class integrated into the Weave type system?
- The `Const` class is assigned to the `instance_classes` attribute of the `types.Const` class.

3. What is the purpose of the `const` function?
- The `const` function is used to mark a value as const so that the Weave type system treats it as a `ConstType`.
