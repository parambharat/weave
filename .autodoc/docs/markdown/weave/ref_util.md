The `parse_local_ref_str` function in the `weave` project is designed to parse a string that represents a local reference. A local reference is a string that represents a path to a specific location within a larger document or file. The function takes in a string `s` and returns a tuple containing the path and any additional information about the location.

The function first checks if the string contains a "#" character. If it does not, then the entire string is returned as the path and `None` is returned as the additional information. If the "#" character is present, then the string is split into two parts: the path and the additional information. The path is the part of the string before the "#" character, and the additional information is the part of the string after the "#" character.

The additional information is then split by the "/" character and returned as a list. If there is no additional information, then `None` is returned instead of a list.

This function can be useful in the larger `weave` project for parsing local references within documents or files. For example, if the project involves working with Markdown files, the function could be used to parse local references to specific headings within the file. The returned tuple could then be used to navigate to the specific location within the file. 

Example usage:

```
ref_str = "path/to/file.md#heading/subheading"
path, extra = parse_local_ref_str(ref_str)
print(path) # "path/to/file.md"
print(extra) # ["heading", "subheading"]
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `parse_local_ref_str` function?
- The `parse_local_ref_str` function is used to parse a string that represents a local reference, and returns a tuple containing the path and any extra information.

2. What is the expected input format for the `s` parameter?
- The `s` parameter is expected to be a string that represents a local reference. It should contain a "#" character to separate the path from any extra information.

3. What is the expected output format of the function?
- The function is expected to return a tuple containing a string representing the path and an optional list of strings representing any extra information. If the input string does not contain a "#" character, the function returns the input string and None.
