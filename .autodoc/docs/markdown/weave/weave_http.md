This file provides the official interface for making HTTP requests in the Weave project. The `HttpAsync` and `Http` classes are provided for asynchronous and synchronous requests, respectively. 

The `HttpAsync` class uses the `aiohttp` library to make asynchronous HTTP requests. It takes a `filesystem.FilesystemAsync` object as an argument and creates an `aiohttp.ClientSession` object with a `TCPConnector` and a `DummyCookieJar`. The `download_file` method downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a given path. It first creates the directory for the file using the `makedirs` method of the `FilesystemAsync` object. It then makes an asynchronous GET request to the URL using the `session.get` method of the `aiohttp.ClientSession` object. If the response status is 200, it writes the content of the response to the file using the `open_write` method of the `FilesystemAsync` object. If the response status is not 200, it raises a `WeaveInternalHttpException` exception from the `server_error_handling` module.

The `Http` class uses the `requests` library to make synchronous HTTP requests. It takes a `filesystem.Filesystem` object as an argument and creates a `requests.Session` object. The `download_file` method downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to a given path. It first creates the directory for the file using the `makedirs` method of the `Filesystem` object. It then makes a synchronous GET request to the URL using the `session.get` method of the `requests.Session` object. If the response status is 200, it writes the content of the response to the file using the `open_write` method of the `Filesystem` object. If the response status is not 200, it raises a `WeaveInternalHttpException` exception from the `server_error_handling` module.

Both classes have `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to allow them to be used with the `with` statement. The `logging_trace_config` function is used to configure tracing for the `aiohttp` library. It creates a `TraceConfig` object with event handlers for various stages of the HTTP request/response cycle. If `ENABLE_REQUEST_TRACING` is set to `True`, it adds this `TraceConfig` object to the `ClientSession` object in the `HttpAsync` class. 

Overall, this file provides a consistent interface for making HTTP requests in the Weave project, whether synchronous or asynchronous. It also provides error handling for failed requests and tracing for debugging purposes. 

Example usage:

```
from weave import HttpAsync, Http, filesystem

fs = filesystem.FilesystemAsync()
async with HttpAsync(fs) as http:
    await http.download_file("https://example.com/file.txt", "/path/to/file.txt")

fs = filesystem.Filesystem()
with Http(fs) as http:
    http.download_file("https://example.com/file.txt", "/path/to/file.txt")
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?
- The code provides an official interface for making http requests and all interactions with http servers in the `weave` project should go through this interface.

2. What is the purpose of the `ENABLE_REQUEST_TRACING` variable and how does it affect the behavior of the code?
- The `ENABLE_REQUEST_TRACING` variable is used to turn on/off printing of stats for each request. If it is set to `True`, the `logging_trace_config()` function will be called to configure tracing for the `aiohttp` client session.

3. What is the difference between the `HttpAsync` and `Http` classes and when should each be used?
- The `HttpAsync` class is an asynchronous version of the `Http` class and should be used when making http requests asynchronously. The `Http` class is a synchronous version and should be used when making http requests synchronously.
