The `weave` module provides functionality for working with files and directories in the Weave project. The module defines several classes and functions for working with files and directories, including `File`, `Dir`, `SubDir`, `FileBaseType`, and `SubDirType`. 

The `File` class represents a file in the Weave project. It defines several methods for working with files, including `size()`, `open()`, and `digest()`. The `Dir` class represents a directory in the Weave project. It defines a method `path_info()` for retrieving information about a file or directory at a given path. The `SubDir` class represents a subdirectory in the Weave project. 

The `FileBaseType` and `SubDirType` classes are used to define the types of `File` and `SubDir` instances, respectively. These classes define the properties of `File` and `SubDir` instances, including `fullPath`, `size`, `dirs`, and `files`. 

The `wb_object_type_from_path()` function is used to determine the type of a Weave object based on its path. The function takes a path as input and returns a tuple containing the object type and file extension. 

Overall, the `weave` module provides a set of classes and functions for working with files and directories in the Weave project. These classes and functions can be used to read, write, and manipulate files and directories in the project. 

Example usage:

```
from weave import File

# create a new file
f = File()
f.path = "/path/to/file.txt"

# get the size of the file
size = f.size()

# open the file for reading
with f.open("r") as file:
    contents = file.read()

# get the digest of the file
digest = f.digest()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `wb_object_type_from_path` function?
- The `wb_object_type_from_path` function takes a file path and returns a tuple containing the file's Weave object type and its extension.
2. What is the relationship between the `File` class and the `FileBaseType` class?
- The `FileBaseType` class is a dataclass that defines the type of a `File` object, including its extension and Weave object type. The `type_of_instance` method of `FileBaseType` is used to create an instance of `FileBaseType` from a `File` object.
3. What is the purpose of the `SubDirType` class?
- The `SubDirType` class is a dataclass that defines the type of a subdirectory in Weave, including its full path, size, and the types of its files. It is used in the `BaseDirType` class to define the types of directories in Weave.
