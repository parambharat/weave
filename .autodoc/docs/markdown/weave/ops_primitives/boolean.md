The `weave` project includes a file called `Boolean` that defines a class with several methods for performing boolean operations. The class is decorated with `weave_class`, which specifies that the class represents a boolean type. 

The `Boolean` class includes methods for performing equality and inequality comparisons (`bool_equals` and `bool_notEquals`, respectively), logical AND and OR operations (`bool_and` and `bool_or`), and negation (`bool_not`). Each method is decorated with `op`, which specifies the name of the operation as it will be used in the larger project. 

The `none_coalesce` function is also included in this file, and is decorated with `op` as well. This function takes two arguments and returns the first one that is not `None`. 

Overall, this code provides a set of boolean operations that can be used throughout the `weave` project. For example, if another part of the project needs to perform a logical AND operation on two boolean values, it can import the `Boolean` class and call the `bool_and` method. Similarly, if it needs to perform a coalesce operation on two values, it can import the `none_coalesce` function and call it with the appropriate arguments. 

Example usage:

```
from weave.Boolean import Boolean

# perform a logical AND operation
result = Boolean.bool_and(True, False)  # returns False

# perform a coalesce operation
result = none_coalesce(None, "default value")  # returns "default value"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_class` decorator used in the `Boolean` class?
    
    The `weave_class` decorator is used to specify the weave type for the `Boolean` class.

2. What is the purpose of the `op` decorator used in the methods of the `Boolean` class and the `none_coalesce` function?
    
    The `op` decorator is used to mark the methods and function as operations that can be executed by the weave engine.

3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comment in the `none_coalesce` function?
    
    The `TODO` comment indicates that the logic in the function is complicated and needs to be improved in a future version of the project.
