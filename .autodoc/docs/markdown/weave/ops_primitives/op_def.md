This code defines a class called `OpDefNodeMethods` that contains two methods: `op_name` and `output_type`. The class is decorated with `weave_class` from the `weave` module, which indicates that it is a class that should be woven into the larger project. The `weave_type` argument specifies that this class should be treated as an `OpDefType`.

The `op_name` method returns the `simple_name` attribute of the object it is called on, which is expected to be an instance of `OpDefNodeMethods`. This method is decorated with `op`, which indicates that it is an operation that can be called from other parts of the project.

The `output_type` method returns the `output_type` attribute of the object it is called on, which is expected to be an instance of `OpDefNodeMethods`. If `output_type` is a callable, it returns an `Invalid` type from the `weave_types` module. This method is also decorated with `op`.

Overall, this code provides two operations that can be called on instances of `OpDefNodeMethods` objects: `op_name` and `output_type`. These operations are defined in a way that allows them to be woven into the larger project and used by other parts of the codebase. 

Example usage:

```
from weave.op_def_node_methods import OpDefNodeMethods

# create an instance of OpDefNodeMethods
op_def_node = OpDefNodeMethods()

# call the op_name operation
name = op_def_node.op_name()

# call the output_type operation
output_type = op_def_node.output_type()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_class` decorator used on the `OpDefNodeMethods` class?
- The `weave_class` decorator is used to indicate that the `OpDefNodeMethods` class should be woven into the `OpDefType` class.

2. Why is the `op_name` method named that way instead of just `name`?
- The `op_name` method is named that way because `name` is already an attribute of the `VarNode` class, and renaming it would require a fix.

3. What does the `output_type` method return?
- The `output_type` method returns a `Type` object, which is either the output type of the `OpDef` or an `Invalid` type if the output type is callable.
