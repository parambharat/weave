This file contains two functions, `map_to_python` and `map_from_python`, which are used to map data between Python objects and Weave artifacts. The purpose of these functions is to provide a way to convert data from one format to another, allowing for interoperability between different parts of the larger Weave project.

The `map_to_python` function takes a `weave_types.Type` object, an `artifact_base.Artifact` object, and optional `path` and `mapper_options` arguments. It returns a `mappers.Mapper` object. The purpose of this function is to map data from a Weave artifact to a Python object. The `type_` argument specifies the type of the Python object to be created, while the `artifact` argument contains the data to be mapped. The `path` argument is used to specify a path within the artifact to the data to be mapped, while the `mapper_options` argument can be used to specify additional options for the mapping process.

The `map_from_python` function is similar to `map_to_python`, but is used to map data from a Python object to a Weave artifact. It takes the same arguments as `map_to_python`, but returns a `mappers.Mapper` object that maps data from a Python object to a Weave artifact.

Both functions are designed to work with other parts of the Weave project, such as the `mappers_python_def` module, which contains the actual implementation of the mapping process. By separating the mapping functions from the implementation, the code avoids circular dependencies and allows for greater flexibility in how the mapping process is implemented.

Here is an example of how these functions might be used in the larger Weave project:

```
import weave
import json

# Create a Weave artifact containing some data
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
artifact = weave.artifact_base.Artifact(json.dumps(data))

# Map the data to a Python object
person = weave.map_to_python(weave_types.Type("Person"), artifact)

# Modify the Python object
person["age"] += 1

# Map the modified object back to a Weave artifact
modified_artifact = weave.map_from_python(weave_types.Type("Person"), person)

# Print the modified artifact
print(modified_artifact.data)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` module and where is it defined?
- A smart developer might ask where the `weave_types` module is defined and what its purpose is within the `weave` project.

2. What is the expected behavior of the `map_to_python` and `map_from_python` functions?
- A smart developer might ask for more information about the expected behavior of the `map_to_python` and `map_from_python` functions, including what arguments they take and what they are intended to return.

3. What is the significance of the `type_: "weave_types.Type"` argument in the function signatures?
- A smart developer might ask about the significance of the `type_: "weave_types.Type"` argument in the function signatures, including whether it is a required argument and what its purpose is within the functions.
