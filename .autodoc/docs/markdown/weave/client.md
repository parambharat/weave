The `weave` project includes a module called `storage` and another called `weave_types`. This file imports those modules and defines two classes: `Client` and `NonCachingClient`. 

The `Client` class takes a `server` argument in its constructor and stores it as an instance variable. It also defines an `execute` method that takes a `nodes` argument and an optional `no_cache` argument (defaulting to `False`). The `execute` method calls the `execute` method of the `server` instance variable with the `nodes` and `no_cache` arguments, and stores the results in a `results` variable. It then iterates over the `nodes` and `results` in parallel, and for each pair, it checks if the node's type is a `RefType` (defined in `weave_types`). If it is, it returns the result as-is. If it is not, it calls the `deref` function from the `storage` module on the result before returning it. The purpose of this logic is to dereference any results that are references to other objects in the `storage` module, so that the actual values are returned instead of the references.

The `NonCachingClient` class is similar to the `Client` class, but it always sets the `no_cache` argument to `True` when calling the `execute` method of the `server` instance variable. This means that the server will not cache any results, which can be useful in certain situations where caching is not desired.

Overall, these classes provide a way to execute nodes on a server and retrieve the results, with the option to dereference any reference-type results. The `NonCachingClient` class provides an additional option to disable caching on the server. These classes can be used in the larger `weave` project to interact with the server and retrieve results from executed nodes. 

Example usage:

```
from weave import Client, NonCachingClient
from weave.server import Server

# create a server instance
server = Server()

# create a client instance
client = Client(server)

# create some nodes to execute
nodes = [Node("a = 1"), Node("b = 2"), Node("c = a + b")]

# execute the nodes and retrieve the results
results = client.execute(nodes)

# print the results
for result in results:
    print(result)

# create a non-caching client instance
non_caching_client = NonCachingClient(server)

# execute the same nodes with caching disabled
results = non_caching_client.execute(nodes)

# print the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Client` and `NonCachingClient` classes?
- The `Client` and `NonCachingClient` classes are used to execute nodes on a server and return the results. The `Client` class caches results by default, while the `NonCachingClient` class does not.

2. What is the `weave_types` module used for?
- The `weave_types` module is imported to check if a node's output type is a `RefType` or not. This is used to determine whether or not to dereference the result.

3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comments in the `execute` method of the `Client` and `NonCachingClient` classes?
- The `TODO` comments suggest that the logic for dereferencing results should be moved to a different file and done during the compile pass. The comment in `server.py:_handle_request` suggests that this logic is duplicated and should be consolidated.
