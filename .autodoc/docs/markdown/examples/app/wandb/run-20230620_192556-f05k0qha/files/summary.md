The `.autodoc/docs/json/examples/app/wandb/run-20230620_192556-f05k0qha/files` folder contains configuration files, dependencies, and metadata for the Weave project, which uses the Weights and Biases (wandb) library to track and visualize machine learning experiments.

`config.yaml` is a configuration file that sets up the environment for running experiments with wandb and tracks important metadata. To use this configuration file in a Python script, you can initialize wandb with the file path:

```python
import wandb
wandb.init(config="weave/wandb_config.yaml")
```

`requirements.txt` lists the project's dependencies and their versions, ensuring compatibility across different environments. To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`wandb-metadata.json` provides a snapshot of the system state, including information about the operating system, Python version, and hardware components. This can be useful for debugging and performance analysis. To collect system information using the `psutil` library, you can use the following code:

```python
import json
import psutil

system_info = {
    "os": psutil.os.name(),
    "python": psutil.version_info(),
    "cpu_count": psutil.cpu_count(),
    "cpu_freq": psutil.cpu_freq(),
    "memory": psutil.virtual_memory(),
    "disk": psutil.disk_usage("/")
}

json.dump(system_info, open("system_info.json", "w"))
```

`wandb-summary.json` contains metadata about a table file stored as an artifact in WandB. To access the table file, you can use the following code:

```python
import wandb

wandb.init()
table_artifact = wandb.Artifact("table", type="table-file")
table_file = table_artifact.download()

with open(table_file.name, "r") as f:
    table_data = f.read()

print(table_data)
```

The `media` subfolder contains a JSON template for creating tables with a single "Image" column (`table_0_9982ca78f8148857dcb6.table.json`). To create a new table using this template and add new rows with image names, you can use the following code:

```python
import json

template = '{"columns": ["Image"], "data": [["Image"]]}'
table = json.loads(template)

new_images = ["Image1", "Image2", "Image3"]

for image_name in new_images:
    table["data"].append([image_name])
```

In summary, this folder contains essential files for setting up the environment, tracking dependencies, and managing metadata for the Weave project, which uses wandb to track and visualize machine learning experiments. The provided code examples demonstrate how to use these files in various parts of the project.
