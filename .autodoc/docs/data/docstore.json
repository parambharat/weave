By collecting system information at regular intervals, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the code for specific hardware configurations.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in practice:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport psutil\n\nsystem_info = {\n    \"os\": psutil.os.name(),\n    \"python\": psutil.version_info(),\n    \"cpu_count\": psutil.cpu_count(),\n    \"cpu_freq\": psutil.cpu_freq(),\n    \"memory\": psutil.virtual_memory(),\n    \"disk\": psutil.disk_usage(\"/\")\n}\n\njson.dump(system_info, open(\"system_info.json\", \"w\"))\n```\n\nThis code uses the `psutil` library to collect system information and stores it in a JSON file. By running this code at regular intervals, developers can track changes in system performance over time and identify potential issues.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the project?\n- This code provides system information about the environment in which the project is running, such as the operating system, Python version, CPU and GPU information, and disk and memory usage. It is likely used for monitoring and optimizing performance of the project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"state\" field in the code?\n- The \"state\" field indicates the current state of the program, which in this case is \"running\". This could be useful for tracking the progress of the program or identifying any issues that may arise during execution.\n\n3. How is the CPU frequency information organized in the code?\n- The CPU frequency information is organized into two fields: \"cpu_freq\", which provides the current, minimum, and maximum frequencies for all CPU cores, and \"cpu_freq_per_core\", which provides the same information for each individual CPU core. This could be useful for identifying any performance issues or imbalances across different cores.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/examples/app/wandb/run-20230620_192556-f05k0qha/files/wandb-metadata.md"}}],["12",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/examples/app/wandb/run-20230620_192556-f05k0qha/files/wandb-summary.json)\n\nThe code provided is a JSON object that contains information about a table file. The table file is stored as an artifact in the WandB platform, which is a tool for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments. The JSON object contains metadata about the table file, such as its size, SHA256 hash, number of rows and columns, and the path to the file.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to access and manipulate the table file in the larger project. The table file may contain data that is used in machine learning models or for analysis purposes. By storing the file as an artifact in WandB, the file can be easily versioned and shared among team members.\n\nTo access the table file, the code may use the artifact path provided in the JSON object. For example, the following Python code could be used to download the table file from WandB:\n\n```python\nimport wandb\n\n# Initialize WandB\nwandb.init()\n\n# Access the table artifact\ntable_artifact = wandb.Artifact(\"table\", type=\"table-file\")\n\n# Download the table file\ntable_file = table_artifact.download()\n\n# Read the table file\nwith open(table_file.name, \"r\") as f:\n    table_data = f.read()\n\n# Do something with the table data\nprint(table_data)\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to store and access a table file in the WandB platform, which can be useful for tracking and sharing data in machine learning projects.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code alone does not provide enough context to determine the purpose of the `weave` project or how this code fits into it. More information is needed.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `table` dictionary and its keys/values?\n- The `table` dictionary contains information about a table file, including its type, SHA256 hash, size, artifact path, latest artifact path, file path, number of columns, and number of rows.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `_timestamp`, `_runtime`, `_step`, and `_wandb` keys and their values?\n- The `_timestamp` key contains a Unix timestamp, the `_runtime` key contains a float representing the runtime of the code, the `_step` key contains an integer representing the step in a process, and the `_wandb` key contains a dictionary with a `runtime` key and its value.

It takes three input parameters: `a` and `b` are integers, and `sleep` is a float. It returns a function that takes no input and returns an integer. The function multiplies `a` and `b` together, but does so slowly by sleeping for `sleep` seconds between each iteration of the loop. The `_run` parameter is used to print the current result and set the output of the function.\n\nThe `train` function is another example of an asynchronous Weave operation. It takes a list of dictionaries as input, where each dictionary has a `prompt` key and a `completion` key, both of which are strings.

The function prints \"starting\", creates an instance of `AsyncDemoTrainResult` with the `id` of the first prompt in the dataset, sets it as the output of the function, and prints \"done\".\n\nThese classes and functions can be used to build and deploy machine learning models on the Weave platform. For example, `AsyncDemoModel` could be used as a component in a larger machine learning model, and `slowmult` and `train` could be used to train and test the model asynchronously.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to execute a large number of asynchronous tasks while limiting the number of tasks that are running at any given time. This can be useful in situations where too many tasks running in parallel can cause performance issues or resource constraints.\n\nThe first implementation, `map_with_parallel_workers`, creates a specified number of worker tasks that are responsible for processing items from a queue. The function takes a list of items to process, a task function that takes an item and returns a result, and a maximum number of parallel tasks to run. The function creates a queue for requests and a queue for responses, and then creates the worker tasks. Each worker task waits for a request from the request queue, processes the item using the task function, and then puts the result into the response queue. The main function adds each item to the request queue and then waits for a response for each item, storing the result in a list. Once all items have been processed, the worker tasks are cancelled and the list of results is returned.\n\nThe second implementation, `map_with_n_live_tasks`, creates tasks as needed to process items from a list. The function takes the same arguments as the first implementation. The function creates a queue for responses and then enters a loop that continues until all items have been processed and all tasks have completed. The loop checks if the maximum number of parallel tasks has been reached and if there are more items to process. If both conditions are true, a new task is created to process the next item. If not, the function waits for a response from the response queue and stores the result in a list. Once all items have been processed and all tasks have completed, the list of results is returned.\n\nBoth implementations use asyncio to manage the asynchronous tasks. These functions can be used in the larger project to process large numbers of asynchronous tasks while limiting the number of tasks that are running at any given time. For example, these functions could be used to process a large number of HTTP requests while limiting the number of requests that are sent at any given time to avoid overloading a server. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nasync def task_function(item):\n    # process item asynchronously and return result\n    ...\n\nitems = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nresults = await map_with_parallel_workers(items, task_function, max_parallel=3)\nprint(results)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `map_parallel_worker` function?\n   \n   The `map_parallel_worker` function is an async function that takes a task, a request queue, and a response queue as input, and runs an infinite loop that gets an item from the request queue, applies the task to the item, and puts the result in the response queue.\n\n2. What is the difference between `map_with_parallel_workers` and `map_with_n_live_tasks`?\n   \n   `map_with_parallel_workers` and `map_with_n_live_tasks` are both async functions that take a list of items and a task as input, and apply the task to each item in the list. However, `map_with_parallel_workers` limits the number of tasks that run in parallel by creating a fixed number of worker tasks, while `map_with_n_live_tasks` limits the number of tasks that are \"live\" (i.e., actively running) at any given time by dynamically creating new tasks as old ones complete.\n\n3. Why are these functions not used in the Weave code base right now?\n   \n   The code comments state that these functions were implemented to understand performance, but the results were inconclusive. Therefore, they are not currently used in the Weave code base.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/async_map.md"}}],["36",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/async_queue.py)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a module that defines two classes: `ProcessQueue` and `ThreadQueue`. These classes are implementations of a generic `Queue` class, which defines a set of methods for interacting with a queue data structure. The `Queue` class is a generic class, meaning that it can be instantiated with a type parameter that specifies the type of items that will be stored in the queue.\n\nThe `ProcessQueue` class is designed to be used in a multi-process environment. It uses the `aioprocessing` library to implement a queue that can be used asynchronously. The `async_put`, `async_get`, and `async_join` methods are all asynchronous methods that can be awaited in an `asyncio` event loop. The `put`, `get`, and `join` methods are synchronous methods that can be used in a non-async context. The `task_done` method is used to indicate that a task has been completed and can be removed from the queue.\n\nThe `ThreadQueue` class is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment. It uses the `janus` library to implement a queue that can be used asynchronously. The `async_put`, `async_get`, and `async_join` methods are all asynchronous methods that can be awaited in an `asyncio` event loop. The `put`, `get`, and `join` methods are synchronous methods that can be used in a non-async context. The `task_done` method is used to indicate that a task has been completed and can be removed from the queue.\n\nBoth classes implement the same set of methods, so they can be used interchangeably in the `weave` project. The `ProcessQueue` class is designed to be used in a multi-process environment, while the `ThreadQueue` class is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment. By providing two different implementations of the `Queue` class, the `weave` project can be used in a variety of different environments without needing to modify the code that uses the queue. \n\nHere is an example of how the `ProcessQueue` class might be used in the `weave` project:\n\n```\nimport asyncio\nfrom weave import ProcessQueue\n\nasync def worker(queue):\n    while True:\n        item = await queue.async_get()\n        # process item\n        queue.task_done()\n\nasync def main():\n    queue = ProcessQueue()\n    tasks = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(worker(queue)))\n    for i in range(100):\n        await queue.async_put(i)\n    await queue.async_join()\n    for task in tasks:\n        task.cancel()\n    await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this example, a `ProcessQueue` is created and used to communicate between multiple worker tasks. The `async_put` method is used to add items to the queue, and the `async_get` method is used to retrieve items from the queue. The `async_join` method is used to wait for all items to be processed before exiting the program.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Queue` class and its methods?\n- The `Queue` class is a generic class that defines methods for putting and getting items from a queue, as well as joining and marking tasks as done. However, all of its methods raise a `NotImplementedError` and must be implemented by subclasses.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `ProcessQueue` and `ThreadQueue` classes?\n- The `ProcessQueue` class uses the `aioprocessing` library to create a queue that can be used across multiple processes, while the `ThreadQueue` class uses the `janus` library to create a queue that can be used across multiple threads.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `init` method in the `ThreadQueue` class?\n- The `init` method initializes the `janus.Queue` object used by the `ThreadQueue` class, setting its maximum size to the value passed to the constructor. This method is called lazily the first time the `queue` property is accessed.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/async_queue.md"}}],["37",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/box.py)\n\nThe `weave` module provides a set of classes and functions for boxing and unboxing Python objects. Boxing is the process of wrapping a Python object in a new object that provides additional functionality, such as the ability to track object identity or to be used in a numpy array. Unboxing is the process of extracting the original Python object from a boxed object.\n\nThe module defines several classes for boxing different types of Python objects, including `BoxedInt`, `BoxedFloat`, `BoxedStr`, `BoxedBool`, `BoxedDict`, `BoxedList`, `BoxedNDArray`, `BoxedNone`, `BoxedDatetime`, and `BoxedTimedelta`. Each of these classes inherits from the corresponding built-in Python class, and adds an optional `_id` attribute that can be used to track object identity.\n\nThe `box` function takes a Python object as input and returns a boxed version of the object. If the input object is already a boxed object, the function returns the input object unchanged. The function uses type checking to determine which type of boxed object to create, and returns the appropriate boxed object.\n\nThe `unbox` function takes a boxed object as input and returns the original Python object. If the input object is not a boxed object, the function returns the input object unchanged. The function uses type checking to determine which type of Python object to create, and returns the appropriate Python object.\n\nThe module also defines several utility functions, including `make_id`, which generates a random 64-bit integer, and `cannot_have_weakref`, which returns True if the input object cannot be used with weak references.\n\nThis module can be used in a larger project to provide a consistent way of boxing and unboxing Python objects, which can be useful for tracking object identity or for working with numpy arrays. For example, if a project needs to store a large number of numpy arrays with associated metadata, the `BoxedNDArray` class can be used to wrap the arrays and provide additional functionality, such as the ability to track the identity of the array. Similarly, the `BoxedDatetime` and `BoxedTimedelta` classes can be used to wrap datetime objects and provide additional functionality, such as the ability to compare datetimes with different time zones.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Boxed` classes?\n- The `Boxed` classes are used to wrap primitive data types and provide additional functionality such as equality comparison and optional IDs.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `box` and `unbox` functions?\n- The `box` function is used to wrap primitive data types in their corresponding `Boxed` class, while the `unbox` function is used to extract the primitive value from a `Boxed` object.\n\n3. Why is `cannot_have_weakref` necessary?\n- `cannot_have_weakref` is necessary because weak references cannot be created for certain `Boxed` objects, specifically those that inherit from primitive data types such as `int`, `float`, and `str`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/box.md"}}],["38",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/cache.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains a class called `LruTimeWindowCache` which is a cache that stores values for a fixed amount of time. The cache is implemented as a dictionary with keys being a tuple of a user ID and a cache key, and values being a tuple of a timestamp and a cache value. The cache is time-ordered, with the oldest item at the front. The cache respects the user cache key, so that different users don't share the same cache.\n\nThe `LruTimeWindowCache` class has two type variables, `CacheKeyType` and `CacheValueType`, which represent the types of the cache key and value, respectively. The class has two methods, `get` and `set`, which get and set values in the cache, respectively. The `get` method takes a cache key and returns the corresponding cache value if it exists in the cache and has not expired, otherwise it returns a special `NotFound` object. The `set` method takes a cache key and value and adds it to the cache, or updates the value if the key already exists in the cache.\n\nThe `LruTimeWindowCache` class also has a constructor that takes a `max_age` parameter, which is a `datetime.timedelta` object representing the maximum age of a cache item, and an optional `now_fn` parameter, which is a function that returns the current time as a `datetime.datetime` object. The `constructor initializes the cache as an empty dictionary.\n\nThe `weave` module also imports several other modules, including `engine_trace`, `wandb_api`, `environment`, and `errors`. The `engine_trace` module contains a `statsd` function that returns a `statsd` client object, which is used to track cache hits and misses. The `wandb_api` module contains a `get_wandb_api_context` function that returns a context object containing information about the current user, including their user ID. The `environment` module contains a `is_public` function that returns `True` if the current environment is a public environment, and `False` otherwise. The `errors` module contains several error classes that are used throughout the `weave` project.\n\nOverall, the `LruTimeWindowCache` class provides a simple and efficient way to cache values for a fixed amount of time, while respecting user boundaries. It can be used in the larger `weave` project to cache the results of expensive computations or API calls, and to reduce the load on external services.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This file imports those modules and defines two classes: `Client` and `NonCachingClient`. \n\nThe `Client` class takes a `server` argument in its constructor and stores it as an instance variable. It also defines an `execute` method that takes a `nodes` argument and an optional `no_cache` argument (defaulting to `False`). The `execute` method calls the `execute` method of the `server` instance variable with the `nodes` and `no_cache` arguments, and stores the results in a `results` variable. It then iterates over the `nodes` and `results` in parallel, and for each pair, it checks if the node's type is a `RefType` (defined in `weave_types`). If it is, it returns the result as-is. If it is not, it calls the `deref` function from the `storage` module on the result before returning it. The purpose of this logic is to dereference any results that are references to other objects in the `storage` module, so that the actual values are returned instead of the references.\n\nThe `NonCachingClient` class is similar to the `Client` class, but it always sets the `no_cache` argument to `True` when calling the `execute` method of the `server` instance variable. This means that the server will not cache any results, which can be useful in certain situations where caching is not desired.\n\nOverall, these classes provide a way to execute nodes on a server and retrieve the results, with the option to dereference any reference-type results. The `NonCachingClient` class provides an additional option to disable caching on the server. These classes can be used in the larger `weave` project to interact with the server and retrieve results from executed nodes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom weave import Client, NonCachingClient\nfrom weave.server import Server\n\n# create a server instance\nserver = Server()\n\n# create a client instance\nclient = Client(server)\n\n# create some nodes to execute\nnodes = [Node(\"a = 1\"), Node(\"b = 2\"), Node(\"c = a + b\")]\n\n# execute the nodes and retrieve the results\nresults = client.execute(nodes)\n\n# print the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n\n# create a non-caching client instance\nnon_caching_client = NonCachingClient(server)\n\n# execute the same nodes with caching disabled\nresults = non_caching_client.execute(nodes)\n\n# print the results\nfor result in results:\n    print(result)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `Client` class caches results by default, while the `NonCachingClient` class does not.\n\n2. What is the `weave_types` module used for?\n- The `weave_types` module is imported to check if a node's output type is a `RefType` or not. This is used to determine whether or not to dereference the result.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comments in the `execute` method of the `Client` and `NonCachingClient` classes?\n- The `TODO` comments suggest that the logic for dereferencing results should be moved to a different file and done during the compile pass.

The `execute` method may be used to perform some action on the `nodes` provided, and the returned list may contain the results of that action. The `no_cache` parameter may be used to specify whether or not to use cached data for the action.\n\nHere is an example of how this protocol may be implemented:\n\n```\nclass MyClient(ClientInterface):\n    def execute(self, nodes, no_cache=False) -> list[typing.Any]:\n        results = []\n        for node in nodes:\n            # perform some action on the node\n            result = node.do_something()\n            results.append(result)\n        return results\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyClient` implements the `ClientInterface` protocol by defining an `execute` method that takes in a list of `nodes`, performs some action on each node, and returns a list of the results.

It then appends the `__frontend/weave_jupyter` path to the URL.\n\nThese functions and context managers are used to set up and manage clients and servers for the Weave project. They provide a way to switch between different types of servers and clients depending on the use case. For example, the `local_http_client` context manager can be used during development to test the Weave server locally, while the `weavejs_client` context manager can be used with the Weave.js library. The `get_client` and `get_frontend_url` functions provide a way to get the current client and frontend URL from the context.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This object can be any function or method that takes arguments and returns a value. The function returns a new callable object that wraps the original function and adds tracing functionality.\n\nWhen the decorated function is called, the `trace` function prints information about the call, including the name of the function, the arguments passed to it, and the keyword arguments passed to it.

The graph module provides classes and functions for creating and manipulating the weave graph, while the types module provides classes for representing and manipulating types within the weave graph.\n\nThe first function in this module, assign_type_weave0_weave1, takes two arguments, w0_type and w1_type, both of which are instances of the Type class from the types module. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether w1_type can be assigned to w0_type. This function is used to check whether the types of two nodes in the weave graph are compatible.\n\nThe second function, check_weave0_compile_result, takes two arguments, weave0_nodes and weave1_nodes, both of which are lists of Node objects from the graph module. The function first flattens the lists of nodes to include only OutputNode objects. It then checks whether the two lists have the same length, and raises a ValueError if they do not. For each pair of corresponding nodes in the two lists, the function checks whether their names and types are compatible.

The purpose of `why_not_assignable` is to determine whether two types are assignable to each other. If they are not, the function returns a string that explains why they are not assignable. If they are assignable, the function returns `None`. The function takes two arguments, `to_type` and `from_type`, which are instances of the `Type` class defined in the `weave_types` module. \n\nThe function first checks if either `to_type` or `from_type` is an instance of the `Any` class, which is a special type that can be assigned to any other type. If either of them is `Any`, the function returns `None`. If neither of them is `Any`, the function checks if `from_type` is a union type. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with each member of the union type until it finds a member that is not assignable to `to_type`. If it finds such a member, it adds a reason to a list of reasons why the types are not assignable. If `from_type` is not a union type, the function checks if `to_type` is a union type and recursively calls itself with each member of `to_type` until it finds a member that is not assignable from `from_type`. If it finds such a member, it adds a reason to the list of reasons. \n\nThe function then checks for several other cases where the types are not assignable, such as when `from_type` is a `TaggedValueType` and `to_type` is not, or when `from_type` is a `Const` and `to_type` is not. If none of these cases apply, the function checks if `to_type` and `from_type` are functions, and if so, recursively calls itself with the output type of `from_type` and `to_type`. If `from_type` is a `TypedDict` and `to_type` is a `Dict`, the function recursively calls itself with the object type of `to_type` and each property type of `from_type`. If `from_type` and `to_type` are both `TypedDict`s, the function recursively calls itself with each property type of `to_type` and the corresponding property type of `from_type`. If `to_type` and `from_type` have the same name, the function recursively calls itself with each type variable of `to_type` and the corresponding attribute of `from_type`. If none of these cases apply, the function adds a reason to the list of reasons that the types are not assignable. \n\nFinally, the function checks if the implementation above matches the actual assignability implementation. If the function found reasons why the types are not assignable but the actual assignability implementation says they are assignable, or if the function did not find any reasons but the actual assignability implementation says they are not assignable, the function prints an error message. Otherwise, the function returns `None`. \n\n`short_type` is a simple function that takes a `Type` instance and returns a string representation of it. If the string representation is longer than 40 characters, the function truncates it and adds an ellipsis. This function is used by `why_not_assignable` to generate the string that explains why the types are not assignable. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom weave.weave_types import Int, Float\n\n# These types are assignable\nassert why_not_assignable(Int(), Int()) is None\nassert why_not_assignable(Float(), Float()) is None\nassert why_not_assignable(Int(), Float()) is None\n\n# These types are not assignable\nassert why_not_assignable(Int(), Float()) == \"<Int> !<- <Float>\\nIncompatible types\"\nassert why_not_assignable(Float(), Int()) == \"<Float> !<- <Int>\\nIncompatible types\"\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function returns a decorator function that takes the class being decorated as its argument.\n\nThe decorator function first checks each member of the class to see if it is an instance of `op_def.BoundOpDef`. If it is, the function updates the input types of the operation to include the `weave_type` if it is not already defined.

The `__override_name` argument allows the user to specify a custom name for the Weave type being defined. The `__is_simple` argument is a boolean flag that determines whether the type being defined is a simple type (i.e. a string, integer, etc.) or a more complex type. The `__init` argument is a boolean flag that determines whether the Weave type should have an `__init__` method. \n\nThe `type` decorator wraps a target class and performs several operations on it to create a new Weave type. First, it determines whether the target class has an `__init__` method and sets the `__init__` attribute of the target class to the value of the `__init` argument passed to the decorator. It then creates a new dataclass using the `dataclasses` module, passing in the target class as the class being decorated and the value of the `__init` attribute as the value of the `init` argument. \n\nThe decorator then inspects the fields of the dataclass and creates a new Weave type based on the information it finds.

If `__is_simple` is `False`, the new Weave type is defined as a subclass of the base type only. \n\nThe decorator then creates a new Python type object using the `type` function, passing in the name of the new Weave type, the base types, and an empty dictionary for the class body. It sets several attributes on the new type object, including the name of the target class, the target class itself, and a dictionary of type variables and their corresponding types. It also defines a method called `property_types` on the new type object that returns a dictionary of the names and types of all the properties of the Weave type. \n\nFinally, the decorator defines a new constructor operation for the Weave type using the `decorator_op.op` decorator. This operation takes as input a dictionary of attribute names and values and returns a new instance of the Weave type with those attributes set. \n\nOverall, the `type` decorator provides a convenient way to define new Weave types in Python. By wrapping a target class and setting various attributes and methods on it, the decorator creates a new Weave type that can be used in the larger project to represent custom data structures. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n@weave.type\nclass Person:\n    name: str\n    age: int\n    address: str = \"Unknown\"\n    \np = Person(name=\"Alice\", age=30)\nprint(p.name)  # Output: \"Alice\"\nprint(p.age)  # Output: 30\nprint(p.address)  # Output: \"Unknown\"\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- The purpose of the `weave` project is not clear from this code alone.\n\n2. What is the `type` function doing?\n- The `type` function is a decorator that takes optional arguments and wraps a target class. It creates a new type based on the target class and adds attributes to it based on the fields of the target class.\n\n3. Why is there a circular dependency with ArrowWeave* types?\n- The reason for the circular dependency with ArrowWeave* types is not explained in this code.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/decorator_type.md"}}],["54",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/decorators.py)\n\nThe code above imports four different decorators from separate files within the `weave` project. These decorators are used to modify the behavior of functions, classes, and variables within the project. \n\nThe `op` decorator is used to mark a function as an operation that can be executed within the project. This decorator is used to define the behavior of the project's core functionality. For example, if the `weave` project is a data processing tool, the `op` decorator might be used to define functions that perform specific data processing tasks, such as filtering or sorting.\n\nThe `mutation` decorator is used to mark a function as a mutation that modifies the state of the project. This decorator is used to define functions that modify the project's data or configuration. For example, if the `weave` project is a web application, the `mutation` decorator might be used to define functions that modify the application's database or configuration settings.\n\nThe `weave_class` decorator is used to mark a class as a \"weave class\" that can be used within the project. This decorator is used to define classes that are used to represent data or functionality within the project. For example, if the `weave` project is a game engine, the `weave_class` decorator might be used to define classes that represent game objects, such as characters or items.\n\nThe `type` decorator is used to mark a variable as a specific type within the project. This decorator is used to define the types of variables that are used within the project. For example, if the `weave` project is a scientific computing tool, the `type` decorator might be used to define variables that represent different types of data, such as integers or floating-point numbers.\n\nOverall, these decorators are used to define the behavior and structure of the `weave` project. By using these decorators, developers can easily modify and extend the project's functionality without having to modify the core codebase. For example, a developer could define a new operation using the `op` decorator, and then use that operation within the project without having to modify the project's core code.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- Unfortunately, the provided code snippet does not provide enough information to answer this question. It only shows imports from various decorator modules.\n\n2. What do the imported decorators (`op`, `mutation`, `weave_class`, `type`) do?\n- The `op` decorator is likely used to mark a function as an operation, `mutation` as a mutation, `weave_class` as a class, and `type` as a type. However, without seeing the implementation of these decorators, it is difficult to provide a more detailed answer.\n\n3. What other modules or files are required for this code to work?\n- It is unclear from the provided code snippet what other modules or files are required for this code to work.

A smart developer might want to investigate the `root` module to better understand its role in the project.\n\n2. Why is the `*` wildcard being used in the import statement?\n    \n    The use of the `*` wildcard in the import statement can make it difficult to understand which specific functions or classes are being imported from the `root` module. A smart developer might want to consider using explicit imports instead to improve code clarity and maintainability.\n\n3. Are there any potential naming conflicts or other issues that could arise from using a wildcard import in this context?\n    \n    Depending on the contents of the `root` module and how it is structured, there could be naming conflicts or other issues that arise from using a wildcard import.

The `panels` package contains classes and functions that define the behavior of panels in the `weave` project. Panels are a key component of the `weave` project, as they are used to display and manipulate data in a graphical user interface.\n\nBy importing all modules from the `panels` package, the code makes all panel classes and functions available for use in other parts of the `weave` project. This allows developers to easily create and customize panels to suit their needs.\n\nFor example, a developer could create a new panel by subclassing one of the panel classes imported by this code, and then adding custom behavior to the subclass. They could then use this new panel in their application to display and manipulate data in a way that is tailored to their specific requirements.\n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use the `weave` project to create a custom panel:\n\n```python\nfrom weave.panels import BasePanel\n\nclass MyPanel(BasePanel):\n    def __init__(self, data):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.data = data\n\n    def render(self):\n        # Render the panel using the data\n        pass\n\n# Create an instance of the custom panel\nmy_panel = MyPanel(my_data)\n\n# Add the panel to the application\napp.add_panel(my_panel)\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer creates a new panel class called `MyPanel` that inherits from the `BasePanel` class imported by the code. They then define a constructor that takes some data as an argument, and a `render` method that renders the panel using the data.\n\nFinally, they create an instance of the `MyPanel` class with some data, and add it to the application using the `add_panel` method provided by the `weave` project. This adds the panel to the application's user interface, allowing the user to interact with the data in the panel.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function first extracts the necessary information from the input object, including the encoded input tokens, the BERT model, and the attention matrix.

For example, to save a `torch.Tensor` object to an artifact, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport weave\nimport torch\n\nartifact = weave.Artifact(\"my_artifact\")\ntensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])\nartifact.save(tensor, \"my_tensor\", type=TorchTensorType())\n```\n\nThis saves the `tensor` object to a file named `my_tensor.pt` in the artifact, using the `TorchTensorType`. To load the object back from the artifact, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport weave\nimport torch\n\nartifact = weave.Artifact(\"my_artifact\")\ntensor = artifact.load(\"my_tensor\", type=TorchTensorType())\n```\n\nThis loads the `tensor` object from the artifact, using the `TorchTensorType`. Similarly, you can save and load `torch.nn.Sequential` objects using the `TorchModelType`.\n\nBy providing custom types for handling PyTorch objects, this code allows developers to easily integrate PyTorch models and tensors into the `weave` project, enabling seamless interaction between the `weave` ecosystem and PyTorch-based machine learning models.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ecosystem/pytorch/summary.md"}}],["96",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ecosystem/replicate/__init__.py)\n\nThe code above is used to import the `rep` module from the `weave` package.

It has three attributes: `timestamp`, which is a `datetime.datetime` object representing the time the prediction was made; `input`, which is a float representing the input to the model; and `output`, which is a float representing the output of the model.\n\nThe `EvalModel` class represents a model that can be evaluated using predictions. It has one attribute, `id`, which is a string representing the ID of the model. It also has a method called `all_predictions` that takes two `datetime.datetime` objects representing the start and end times of the prediction window, and returns a list of `Prediction` objects made by the model during that window. This method uses the `weave.ops.objects` function to get all `PredictionProcess` objects (which represent a single run of a model) that have the same `EvalModel` as the current object, and then filters them based on whether their predictions fall within the given window. Finally, it returns a list of all predictions that meet the filter criteria.\n\nThe `PredictionProcess` class represents a single run of a model. It has three attributes: `id`, which is an integer representing the ID of the process; `model`, which is an `EvalModel` object representing the model being run; and `predictions`, which is a list of `Prediction` objects made during the run.\n\nThe `Predictor` class is a subclass of `threading.Thread` that is used to run a model and generate predictions. It takes two arguments: `model_id`, which is a string representing the ID of the model to run; and `run_for_s`, which is a float representing the number of seconds to run the model for. It creates an `EvalModel` object and a `PredictionProcess` object, and then generates 50 random `Prediction` objects every 0.1 seconds for the specified duration. Finally, it saves the `PredictionProcess` object using the `weave.save` function.\n\nOverall, this code provides a framework for running models and generating predictions, and for evaluating models based on their predictions. It is likely used in conjunction with other code in the larger weave project to train and test models, and to analyze their performance. Here is an example of how the `all_predictions` method might be used:\n\n```\nmodel = EvalModel(\"my_model\")\nstart_time = datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)\nend_time = datetime.datetime(2022, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0)\npredictions = model.all_predictions(start_time, end_time)\nprint(predictions)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `all_predictions` method of `EvalModel` returns a list of all predictions made by the model within a given time range.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `PredictionProcess` class?\n    \n    Answer: The `PredictionProcess` class represents a process that generates predictions for a given evaluation model. It contains an ID, a reference to the evaluation model, and a list of predictions.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Predictor` class?\n    \n    Answer: The `Predictor` class is a subclass of `threading.Thread` that generates predictions for a given evaluation model.

The `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` class is a `TypedDict` that defines the structure of an item in the dataset. It has an `id` field, a `class_id` field, a `species` field, a `breed` field, and an `image` field that is an instance of the `PIL.Image.Image` class from the Python Imaging Library. \n\nThe `PetadataRenderConfig` class is defined using the `weave.type()` decorator, which indicates that it is a type that can be used in the `weave` framework. However, it does not have any fields or methods defined, so its purpose is unclear.\n\nThe `PetDatasetPanel` class is defined using the `weave.type()` decorator and extends the `weave.Panel` class. It has an `id` field that is set to `\"PetDatasetPanel\"`, and an `input_node` field that is a `Node` instance containing a list of `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` objects. It also has a `render` method that returns a `Table` instance from the `weave.panels` module. The `Table` instance is initialized with the `input_node` field and a list of functions that define the columns of the table. Each function takes an `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` object as input and returns a value that will be displayed in the corresponding column of the table.\n\nThe `petdataset` function is defined using the `weave.op()` decorator, which indicates that it is an operation that can be used in the `weave` framework. It takes a `raw_data_path` argument that is a string representing the path to the directory containing the dataset files. It returns a list of `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` objects. The function reads the `list.txt` file in the `annotations` subdirectory of the dataset directory, shuffles the lines, and reads the first 50 lines. For each line, it extracts the image ID, class ID, species ID, and breed ID, and constructs an `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` object with the corresponding values. It also opens the image file using the `PIL.Image.open()` function, and sets the `image` field of the `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` object to the resulting `PIL.Image.Image` instance. Finally, it appends the `OxfordIIITPetDatasetItem` object to the `items` list and returns it.\n\nThis code can be used to load the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset into a `weave` pipeline and display it in a table using the `PetDatasetPanel` class. For example:\n\n```\nimport weave\n\nfrom weave.contrib.datasets import petdataset\nfrom weave.contrib.panels import PetDatasetPanel\n\npipeline = weave.Pipeline()\nitems = petdataset(\"/path/to/dataset\")\ninput_node = pipeline.add_node(items)\npanel = PetDatasetPanel(input_node)\npipeline.add_panel(panel)\npipeline.run()\n```\n\nThis code creates a `Pipeline` instance, loads the dataset using the `petdataset` function, adds a `Node` instance containing the dataset items to the pipeline, creates a `PetDatasetPanel` instance with the `Node` instance as input, adds the panel to the pipeline, and runs the pipeline. The result is a table displaying the dataset items.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The input values are first grouped by their rounded value (to one decimal place) using the `groupby` method, and then mapped to a dictionary with keys \"value\" and \"count\" representing the rounded value and the number of occurrences, respectively. The resulting dictionary is used to create the `weave.panels.Plot` object, with the \"value\" and \"count\" keys used as the x and y values, respectively.\n\nThe `AdderConfig` class is a dataclass that defines a single field `operand` of type `weave.Node[int]`. This field is initialized to a `weave.graph.ConstNode` object with value 10 if no default value is provided. \n\nThe `adder_set_default_config` function is a helper function that takes two `AdderConfig` objects and returns the second one, effectively setting the default configuration to the new configuration. \n\nThe `adder_default_config` operation takes an optional `AdderConfig` object as input and returns an `AdderConfig` object with default values if the input is `None`. The default `operand` value is a `weave.Node` object with value 0.1. This operation uses the `adder_set_default_config` function to set the default configuration. \n\nThe `adder_config` operation takes an input `weave.Node[int]` object and an `AdderConfig` object as input and returns a `weave.panels.LabeledItem` object representing a slider for the `operand` field of the `AdderConfig` object.

If no configuration is provided, the default configuration is used.

What is the purpose of the `open_slack_export` function, and why is it marked as impure?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `open_slack_export` function does and why it is marked as impure. \n- Answer: The `open_slack_export` function reads a directory containing Slack export data and returns a `Slack` object that can be used to access the data. It is marked as impure because it reads from the file system, which can have side effects and cause the function to behave differently each time it is called.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ecosystem/slack/slack.md"}}],["116",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ecosystem/slack/slackapi.py)\n\nThe code defines a Python class called `SlackApi` that serves as an interface for reading data from either the Slack API or a Slack data export.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to interleave the data from multiple sources in a deterministic way, so that the output stream is always in the same order regardless of the order in which the input streams are received.\n\nThe weave object is created by calling the `Weave` constructor, which takes an array of input streams as its argument. Each input stream is represented by a `Readable` object, which is a built-in Node.js class for reading data from a stream.

It has three fields: `x_fn`, `y_fn`, and `label_fn`. Each of these fields is a `weave.Node` object that represents a function that takes an input and returns an output. The default value for each field is a `weave.graph.VoidNode`, which is a node that does nothing. \n\n`Scatter` is a subclass of `weave.Panel` that represents a scatter plot panel.

It first unnests the input data using the `weave.ops.unnest` operation. It then defines the `x_fn`, `y_fn`, and `label_fn` fields of the `ScatterConfig` object using `weave.define_fn`. Each of these functions simply returns the input item. The `ScatterConfig` object is returned. \n\n`render_config` is an operation that renders the configuration editor for the scatter plot. It first gets the `ScatterConfig` object from `self.config`. It then creates a `weave.panels.Group` object that contains three `weave.panels.LabeledItem` objects. Each `LabeledItem` object contains a `weave.panels.FunctionEditor` object that represents the function for the corresponding `ScatterConfig` field. The `Group` object is returned. \n\n`render` is an operation that renders the scatter plot. It first gets the input data, `ScatterConfig` object, and unnested input data from `self.input_node`, `self.config`, and `weave.ops.unnest(self.input_node)`, respectively. It then checks if the `x_fn`, `y_fn`, and `label_fn` fields of the `ScatterConfig` object have the correct types using `weave.types.optional` and `weave.types.Float()`, `weave.types.String()`, and `weave.types.Invalid()`, respectively. If any of the fields have the wrong type, a `weave.panels.PanelHtml` object that contains the message \"No data\" is returned. Otherwise, the input data is mapped to a list of dictionaries using `unnested.map` and a lambda function that returns a dictionary with keys \"x\", \"y\", and \"label\" (if `label_fn` is not invalid) and values that are the result of applying `x_fn`, `y_fn`, and `label_fn` to the input item. The resulting list of dictionaries is passed to `weave_plotly.plotly_scatter`, which returns a `plotly.graph_objs.Figure` object. The `Figure` object is then passed to `weave_plotly.PanelPlotly`, which returns a `weave_plotly.PanelPlotly` object that represents the rendered scatter plot. \n\n`selected` is an operation that filters the input data based on the selected region of the scatter plot. It first gets the unnested input data and `ScatterConfig` object from `weave.ops.unnest(self.input_node)` and `self.config`, respectively. It then filters the input data using `unnested.filter` and a lambda function that returns a boolean value based on whether the x and y values of the input item are within the selected region. The filtered data is returned using `weave_internal.use`. \n\nOverall, this code defines a `Scatter` class that represents a scatter plot panel. The `Scatter` class has operations that initialize the configuration, render the configuration editor and scatter plot, and filter the input data based on the selected region. This class can be used in a larger project that involves creating interactive data visualizations using `weave`. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport weave\n\n# create input data\nx = np.random.rand(100)\ny = np.random.rand(100)\ndata = [{\"x\": x[i], \"y\": y[i]} for i in range(100)]\n\n# create scatter plot panel\nscatter = Scatter(input_node=weave.data(data))\n\n# render configuration editor\nconfig_panel = scatter.render_config()\n\n# render scatter plot\nscatter_panel = scatter.render()\n\n# filter input data based on selected region\nscatter.config = ScatterConfig(\n    x_fn=weave.define_fn({\"item\": dict}, lambda item: item[\"x\"]),\n    y_fn=weave.define_fn({\"item\": dict}, lambda item: item[\"y\"]),\n    label_fn=weave.graph.VoidNode()\n)\nscatter._renderAsPanel = scatter_panel\nselected_data = scatter.selected()\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The card has two tabs: \"Description\" and \"Predictions\". The \"Description\" tab contains a `weave.ops.Markdown` object with a description of the Ghostwrite project. The \"Predictions\" tab contains a table of predictions from the \"ghostwrite-test1\" project. \n\nThe `entity_render` operation takes an `wb_domain_types.Entity` object as input and returns a `weave.panels.Card` object. The card has two tabs: \"Projects\" and \"Registered Models\". The \"Projects\" tab contains a table of projects associated with the entity. Each project name is a `weave.panels.WeaveLink` object that links to the corresponding project. The \"Registered Models\" tab contains a table of registered models associated with the entity. Each model name is a `weave.panels.WeaveLink` object that links to the corresponding model. \n\nThe `runs_render` operation takes a list of `wb_domain_types.Run` objects as input and returns a `weave.panels.Table` object. The table has three columns: \"ID\", \"Name\", and \"Created At\". The \"ID\" column contains a `weave.panels.WeaveLink` object that links to the corresponding run. \n\nThe `artifacts_render` operation takes a list of `wb_domain_types.ArtifactCollection` objects as input and returns a `weave.panels.Table` object. The table has two columns: \"Name\" and \"Created At\". The \"Name\" column contains a `weave.panels.WeaveLink` object that links to the corresponding artifact. \n\nThese operations are used to render different types of objects in the Weave project. For example, the `entity_render` operation can be used to render an entity and its associated projects and models. The `runs_render` operation can be used to render a list of runs associated with a project. The `artifacts_render` operation can be used to render a list of artifacts associated with a project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `entity_render` function and what does it return?\n- The `entity_render` function takes a `weave.Node` object representing a `wb_domain_types.Entity` and returns a `weave.panels.Card` object that displays information about the entity, including its projects and registered models.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `artifacts_render` function and why is the commented out code problematic?\n- The `artifacts_render` function takes a `weave.Node` object representing a list of `wb_domain_types.ArtifactCollection` objects and returns a `weave.panels.Table` object that displays information about the artifacts.

The function takes a path as input and returns a tuple containing the object type and file extension. \n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides a set of classes and functions for working with files and directories in the Weave project. These classes and functions can be used to read, write, and manipulate files and directories in the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nfrom weave import File\n\n# create a new file\nf = File()\nf.path = \"/path/to/file.txt\"\n\n# get the size of the file\nsize = f.size()\n\n# open the file for reading\nwith f.open(\"r\") as file:\n    contents = file.read()\n\n# get the digest of the file\ndigest = f.digest()\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `wb_object_type_from_path` function?\n- The `wb_object_type_from_path` function takes a file path and returns a tuple containing the file's Weave object type and its extension.\n2. What is the relationship between the `File` class and the `FileBaseType` class?\n- The `FileBaseType` class is a dataclass that defines the type of a `File` object, including its extension and Weave object type. The `type_of_instance` method of `FileBaseType` is used to create an instance of `FileBaseType` from a `File` object.\n3. What is the purpose of the `SubDirType` class?\n- The `SubDirType` class is a dataclass that defines the type of a subdirectory in Weave, including its full path, size, and the types of its files. It is used in the `BaseDirType` class to define the types of directories in Weave.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/file_base.md"}}],["146",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/file_local.py)\n\nThis code defines classes and functions related to handling local files and directories in the larger project called \"weave\". The `LocalFileType` class inherits from `file_base.FileBaseType` and defines methods for converting instances of `LocalFile` to and from dictionaries. The `LocalFile` class inherits from `file_base.File` and represents a local file on disk. It has methods for opening the file, getting its size, and getting its contents. It also has a method for setting the file contents and a method for getting the local path of the file. \n\nThe `LocalDirType` class inherits from `types.ObjectType` and defines property types for a local directory, including its full path, size, subdirectories, and files. The `LocalDir` class inherits from `file_base.Dir` and represents a local directory on disk. It has a method for getting information about a path within the directory, which can be either a subdirectory or a file. \n\nThe `get_path_type` function takes a path and returns either a `LocalDirType` or `LocalFileType` instance depending on whether the path is a directory or a file. The `get_path_info` function takes a path and returns a `LocalDir` or `LocalFile` instance depending on whether the path is a directory or a file.

This module includes several functions that can be used to manipulate paths, check if a path is allowed, and safely open files.\n\nThe `get_allowed_dir()` function returns the allowed directory for the current user. If the user is not in a public environment, the function returns the root directory. Otherwise, it retrieves the user's cache namespace using the `cache.get_user_cache_key()` function and returns the path to the user's cache directory within the `weave_filesystem_dir()` directory.\n\nThe `path_ext()` function takes a path as input and returns the file extension. It uses the `os.path.splitext()` function to split the path into the base name and extension, and then strips the period from the extension.\n\nThe `check_path()` function takes a path as input and checks if it is allowed based on the user's cache directory. It uses the `get_allowed_dir()` function to retrieve the allowed directory and the `path_util.safe_join()` function to join the allowed directory and the input path. If the resulting path is not within the allowed directory, an exception is raised.\n\nThe `safe_open()` function takes a path and mode as input and safely opens the file. It first checks if the path is allowed using the `check_path()` function, and then uses the built-in `open()` function to open the file with the specified mode. The function returns a file object.\n\nOverall, this module provides useful functions for working with files and directories in a safe and secure way within the `weave` project. For example, the `safe_open()` function can be used to open files within the user's cache directory without the risk of accessing files outside of the allowed directory.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- As a code documentation expert, I cannot determine the purpose of the `weave` project based on the given code alone. \n\n2. What does the `get_allowed_dir()` function do?\n- The `get_allowed_dir()` function returns a `pathlib.Path` object that represents the directory where files can be accessed based on the user's cache namespace. If the user is not public, it returns the root directory.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `safe_open()` function?\n- The `safe_open()` function opens a file in the specified mode after checking if the path is allowed based on the user's cache namespace.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/file_util.md"}}],["148",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/filesystem.py)\n\nThe `weave.filesystem` module provides a sync/async interface for filesystem operations. It is designed to be the official interface for all interactions with the filesystem in the `weave` project. The module provides a `Filesystem` class and a `FilesystemAsync` class, which both have methods for common filesystem operations such as checking if a file exists, getting its size, creating directories, and opening files for reading and writing.\n\nOne important feature of this module is that it provides threadsafe atomic read/write operations. This means that multiple threads can safely read and write to the same file without causing conflicts or data corruption. Another important feature is that the root directory is controlled via context for access control. This means that access to files outside of the root directory is denied, which helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files.\n\nThe `Filesystem` class provides synchronous methods for filesystem operations, while the `FilesystemAsync` class provides asynchronous methods. Both classes have a `path` method that takes a path string and returns a safe path string that is guaranteed to be within the root directory. The `exists`, `getsize`, `makedirs`, `touch`, and `stat` methods are self-explanatory and provide the same functionality as their counterparts in the `os` module.\n\nThe `open_write` and `open_read` methods are context managers that can be used to safely open files for writing and reading, respectively. The `open_write` method opens a file for writing and returns a file object that can be used to write data to the file. When the context is exited, the file is closed and the data is atomically written to the file. The `open_read` method opens a file for reading and returns a file object that can be used to read data from the file. If the `enable_touch_on_read` environment variable is set to `True`, the file's access time is updated to the current time when the file is opened for reading.\n\nThe `is_subdir` function is a helper function that takes two path strings and returns `True` if the first path is a subdirectory of the second path, and `False` otherwise. The `safe_path` function is another helper function that takes a path string and returns a safe path string that is guaranteed to be within the root directory. If the original path is not within the root directory, an exception is raised.\n\nThe `get_filesystem` and `get_filesystem_async` functions return instances of the `Filesystem` and `FilesystemAsync` classes, respectively. The `get_filesystem_dir` function returns the root directory for the filesystem, which is determined by the `weave_filesystem_dir` environment variable and the user's cache key.\n\nOverall, the `weave.filesystem` module provides a safe and reliable interface for interacting with the filesystem in the `weave` project. Its threadsafe atomic read/write operations and access control features help to prevent data corruption and unauthorized access to sensitive files.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- The purpose of the `weave` project is not clear from this code alone. However, this code provides the official sync/async interface for filesystem operations in the project, and all interactions with the filesystem should go through this interface.\n\n2. What are the important features of this filesystem interface?\n- The important features of this filesystem interface include threadsafe atomic read/write operations and root directory controlled via context for access control.\n\n3. Why are there two classes `Filesystem` and `FilesystemAsync`?\n- The two classes `Filesystem` and `FilesystemAsync` provide synchronous and asynchronous versions of the same filesystem interface, respectively. The synchronous version is used for blocking I/O operations, while the asynchronous version is used for non-blocking I/O operations.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/filesystem.md"}}],["149",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/forward_graph.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains code for constructing and executing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes. The DAG is constructed from `graph.Node` objects, which can be of several types, including `graph.ConstNode`, `graph.VarNode`, and `graph.OutputNode`. The DAG is executed by calling `execute_nodes` on a list of `graph.OutputNode` objects, which returns a dictionary of results.\n\nThe `ForwardGraph` class is responsible for constructing the DAG. It takes a list of `graph.Node` objects and adds them to the graph. It also provides methods for checking whether a node has already been executed and getting the result of a node. The `ForwardNode` class represents a node in the DAG and contains a reference to the `graph.Node` it represents, as well as a dictionary of its input nodes and a result store.\n\nThe `NodeResultStore` class is a simple wrapper around a `collections.defaultdict` that stores the results of executed nodes. It also provides a `merge` method for merging the results of two `NodeResultStore` objects.\n\nThe `execute_nodes` function is responsible for executing the DAG. It takes a list of `graph.OutputNode` objects and walks the DAG, executing each node and storing the result in a `NodeResultStore`. If a node has already been executed, its result is retrieved from the `NodeResultStore` instead of being recomputed.\n\nThe `node_result_store` context manager is used to manage the `NodeResultStore` for each call to `execute_nodes`. It creates a new `NodeResultStore` if one is not provided, and stores it in a `contextvars.ContextVar` object. Recursive calls to `execute_nodes` share the top-level `NodeResultStore`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a framework for constructing and executing a DAG of nodes. It can be used in a larger project to represent complex computations as a DAG and execute them efficiently. Here is an example of how to use this code:\n\n```\nfrom weave import graph, execute\n\n# Define some nodes\na = graph.ConstNode(1)\nb = graph.ConstNode(2)\nc = graph.OperationNode(lambda x, y: x + y, [a, b])\nd = graph.OperationNode(lambda x: x * 2, [c])\noutput = graph.OutputNode(d)\n\n# Construct the DAG\ngraph = execute.ForwardGraph()\ngraph.add_nodes([a, b, c, d, output])\n\n# Execute the DAG\nresults = execute.execute_nodes([output])\n\n# Print the result\nprint(results[output])\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The code is organized into several components and utility functions that work together to achieve this functionality.\n\nThe `reactUtils.ts` file provides utility functions for handling React component props. The `pickNameProps` function takes an object and returns a new object containing only the `className` and `id` properties.\n\nThe `Text.tsx` file defines a `SingleLineText` component that renders text with optional `maxWidth` and `alignSelf` properties. If the `maxWidth` property is provided, the text will overflow with no line wrap and ellipsis.\n\nThe `Tags.styles.ts` file defines styled components for icons, including different sizes and positions.\n\nThe `Tags.tsx` file defines two main components: `Tag` and `Tags`. The `Tag` component renders a single tag with a specific size, type, and optional delete functionality. The `Tags` component renders a collection of tags, allowing for optional deletion and click handling.\n\nThe `Component.tsx` file defines a `PanelArtifactVersionAliases` component that fetches and displays a list of artifact version aliases as tags. It uses the `Tag` component from the `Tags.tsx` file to render each alias.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Tags` component can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Tags } from './Tags.tsx';\n\nconst tagsData = [\n  { name: 'tag1', colorIndex: 0 },\n  { name: 'tag2', colorIndex: 1 },\n];\n\nfunction handleDelete(tag) {\n  console.log('Deleted tag:', tag.name);\n}\n\nfunction handleClick(tagName) {\n  console.log('Clicked tag:', tagName);\n}\n\n<Tags\n  size=\"medium\"\n  tags={tagsData}\n  enableDelete\n  noun=\"tag\"\n  deleteTag={handleDelete}\n  onClick={handleClick}\n/>\n```\n\nThis example renders a `Tags` component with two tags, allowing for deletion and click handling.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `pickNameProps` function in the `reactUtils.ts` file?**\n\n   The `pickNameProps` function is used to extract the `className` and `id` properties from a given object (props) and return a new object containing only these properties. This is useful for passing through common props in React components.\n\n2. **How does the `SingleLineText` component handle text overflow and line wrapping?**\n\n   The `SingleLineText` component handles text overflow by setting the `maxWidth` property in its style object. If the `maxWidth` prop is provided, the text will overflow with no line wrap and display an ellipsis. Otherwise, it will not have any specific width constraint.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `nounToTagType` function in the `Tags.tsx` file?**\n\n   The `nounToTagType` function is used to convert a given noun (a string representing the type of tag) to a `TagType` enum value.

The `W` object defines three font sizes that can be used with the `g` component. The `g` component is used to render a tag element with an optional `size`, `name`, `canDelete`, `showColor`, `onDelete`, `onClick`, and `$opacity` props. The `h` component is a memoized version of the `g` component that renders a single tag element. The `C` component is used to render a container element with a horizontal scroll and several flexbox properties.\n\nThe `G` component is the default export of this file. It takes an `input` prop and uses it to fetch data from an external API. The fetched data is an array of artifact aliases, which are used to render tag elements using the `h` component. If the data is still loading, a loading spinner is displayed. If the data is empty, a dash is displayed. Otherwise, the tag elements are displayed inside a horizontal scroll container.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to render tags and text elements with consistent styles and behaviors.

The purpose of this component is to display the result of a data loading operation. \n\nThe component takes a single prop called `input`, which is an object that represents the result of the data loading operation. The `input` object has two properties: `loading` and `result`. If `loading` is true, the component displays a loading spinner. If `result` is null, the component displays a message indicating that no result was found. If `result` is not null, the component displays a message indicating whether the result is true or false.\n\nThe component is implemented using JSX syntax, which allows for the creation of HTML-like elements in JavaScript code. The `createElement` function from the React library is used to create these elements. The component returns a `div` element that contains either a loading spinner, a message indicating that no result was found, or a message indicating whether the result is true or false.\n\nThe component is designed to be used in a larger React application that performs data loading operations. The `input` prop is likely to be passed down from a parent component that is responsible for initiating the data loading operation. The `s` component can then be used to display the result of the operation in a user-friendly way.\n\nHere is an example of how the `s` component might be used in a larger React application:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport s from './Component';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [result, setResult] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchData().then(data => {\n      setLoading(false);\n      setResult(data);\n    });\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Data Loading Example</h1>\n      <s input={{ loading, result }} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nasync function fetchData() {\n  // Perform data loading operation here\n  // Return true, false, or null depending on the result\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `App` component uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to perform a data loading operation when the component is mounted. The `loading` and `result` state variables are used to keep track of the loading status and the result of the operation.

This function returns a `contentsNode` object, which is then passed to the `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook from the `@wandb/weave/react` library. This hook returns a `contentsValueQuery` object, which contains a `loading` property indicating whether the file contents are still being fetched, and a `result` property containing the actual contents of the file.\n\nIf the `loading` property is true, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, it checks if the `content` property is null, and throws an error if it is. Finally, it renders a `div` with a white background, a border, and padding, containing a `Markdown` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components` library. The `condensed` prop of this component is set to `false`, and the `content` prop is set to the `result` property of the `contentsValueQuery` object.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display the contents of markdown files in a panel. It can be imported and used like any other React component, passing in the appropriate props. For example:\n\n```\nimport PanelFileMarkdown from './PanelFileMarkdown';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <PanelFileMarkdown input=\"/path/to/file.md\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a React functional component called `PanelFileMarkdown` that renders a Markdown file within a panel.\n\n2. What dependencies are being imported in this file?\n- This file imports `Markdown` from `@wandb/weave/common/components/Markdown`, `Op` from `@wandb/weave/core`, `React`, `CGReact`, and `Panel2` from `../panel`, and `inputType` from `./common`.\n\n3. What does the `Op.opFileContents` function do?\n- The `Op.opFileContents` function takes an object with a `file` property and returns a Weave node that represents the contents of the specified file.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/frontend/assets/Component.61b64e9a.js.md"}}],["157",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/frontend/assets/Component.61b64e9a.js)\n\nThe code in this file is a module that exports a single function called `i`. The purpose of this function is to render a markdown file as a panel in a web application. The function takes a single argument, which is the path to the markdown file to be rendered.\n\nThe function first imports several modules from the `index.e2c913f5.js` file. These modules are used to load and parse the markdown file. The `r` module is used to load the file, while the `a` module is used to parse the file into a JavaScript object. If the file is still loading, the function returns an empty `div` element. Otherwise, the function extracts the parsed content from the `a` module's result.\n\nIf the parsed content is null, the function throws an error. Otherwise, the function creates a `div` element with a `style` attribute that sets the height to 100% and enables scrolling. Inside this `div`, the function creates another `div` element with a white background, a 1px solid gray border, and 16px of padding. This inner `div` element contains the parsed markdown content, which is rendered using the `s` module.\n\nThe `s` module is a custom component that renders markdown content as HTML. It takes two props: `condensed` and `content`. The `condensed` prop is a boolean that determines whether the rendered HTML should be condensed or not. The `content` prop is the parsed markdown content to be rendered.\n\nOverall, this function is a useful utility for rendering markdown files as panels in a web application. It can be used in conjunction with other components and modules in the larger project to create a rich and interactive user interface. Here is an example of how this function might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport PanelFileMarkdown from './Component';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>\n      <PanelFileMarkdown input=\"./README.md\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `PanelFileMarkdown` component is used to render the `README.md` file as a panel in the app. The resulting HTML will be a `div` element with a white background, a gray border, and 16px of padding, containing the rendered markdown content.\n## Questions: \n 1. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports four dependencies from \"./index.e2c913f5.js\": \"ad\", \"u\", \"W\", and \"ae\". A smart developer might want to know what these dependencies are and how they are used in the code.\n\n2. What does this code do?\n- This code exports a function called \"i\" as the default export. The function takes in an input file and returns a React element that displays the content of the file as a Markdown-formatted panel. A smart developer might want to know how this function is used in the overall project and what other components it interacts with.\n\n3. What error might be thrown by this code?\n- If the result of processing the input file is null, the code will throw an error with the message \"PanelFileMarkdown: content is null\". A smart developer might want to know how this error is handled and what impact it might have on the user experience.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/frontend/assets/Component.61b64e9a.md"}}],["158",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/frontend/assets/Component.74cdf409.js.map)\n\nThe code in this file defines a React component called `BokehViewer` that renders a Bokeh plot. The component takes in a `bokehJson` prop, which is a JSON object representing the Bokeh plot to be rendered. The component first checks if the `bokehJson` prop is defined and has a `version` property. If not, it returns an empty fragment. If the `bokehJson` prop is defined and has a `version` property, the component checks if the Bokeh library has been loaded. If not, it loads the library by injecting a script tag into the document and waits for it to load before setting the `libraryLoaded` state to true. Once the library is loaded, the component renders the `BokehViewerInner` component, which is responsible for rendering the actual Bokeh plot.\n\nThe `BokehViewerInner` component creates a div element with a unique ID and a ref to that element. It then uses the `useEffect` hook to render the Bokeh plot when the `bokehJson` prop changes. If the `bokehJson` prop is not defined or the `contentNotFound` prop is true, the component renders any `notFoundElements` passed in as props. Otherwise, it renders the Bokeh plot using the `Bokeh.embed.embed_item` method.\n\nThe `loadBokehLibrary` function is used to load the Bokeh library by injecting a script tag into the document. It takes in a `version` parameter, which defaults to `'2.2.3'`, and a `callback` parameter, which is called once the library has finished loading. The function first checks if the library has already been loaded by looking for an existing script tag with a specific ID. If the library has not been loaded, it creates a new script tag with the appropriate version and appends it to the document body. It then listens for the script's `load` event and calls the `callback` function once the script has finished loading. If the library has already been loaded, the function simply calls the `callback` function.\n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that involves rendering Bokeh plots in a web application. The `BokehViewer` component can be used to render Bokeh plots by passing in the appropriate `bokehJson` prop. The `loadBokehLibrary` function ensures that the correct version of the Bokeh library is loaded before rendering the plot. Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to render Bokeh plots in a React application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `loadBokehLibrary` function?\n    \n    The `loadBokehLibrary` function injects a bokeh library fetch based on the version of the bokeh content to ensure compatibility between the user's python bokeh version and the JS version.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `BokehViewer` component?\n    \n    The `BokehViewer` component renders a Bokeh plot using the `bokehJson` prop passed to it, after ensuring that the required Bokeh library is loaded.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `PanelBokeh` component?\n    \n    The `PanelBokeh` component is a React functional component that renders a Bokeh plot using the `BokehViewer` component and the `useAssetContentFromArtifact` hook to fetch the Bokeh plot data from an external source.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/frontend/assets/Component.74cdf409.js.md"}}],["159",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/frontend/assets/Component.74cdf409.js)\n\nThe code in this file is a module that exports a single default function called `m`. This function takes an object as an argument, which is expected to have an `input` property containing a URL to a Bokeh visualization. The function then fetches the visualization data from the URL, parses it as JSON, and renders it as an interactive Bokeh plot.\n\nThe `m` function uses several other functions and hooks from the `react` and `weave` modules to accomplish this. The `import` statements at the top of the file bring in the necessary functions and hooks. The `useState`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage state and side effects within the component.\n\nThe `a` function is used to load the Bokeh library from a CDN if it is not already loaded. This function takes two optional arguments: a version string and a callback function to execute when the library is loaded. If the library is already loaded, the callback function is executed immediately. Otherwise, a new `script` element is created and appended to the `document.body`, and the callback function is registered as an event listener for the `load` event of the `script` element.\n\nThe `c` function is a React component that renders the Bokeh plot. It takes an object as an argument, which is expected to have a `bokehJson` property containing the parsed JSON data for the plot. If the `bokehJson` property is present, the component renders the plot using the `h` function. Otherwise, it renders a placeholder element.\n\nThe `h` function is a helper function used by the `c` function to render the Bokeh plot. It creates a new `div` element with a unique `id` based on the current timestamp, and uses the `window.Bokeh.embed.embed_item` function to embed the plot in the `div`. The `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks are used to manage the lifecycle of the `div` element.\n\nFinally, the `m` function is the main component that renders the Bokeh plot. It uses the `l` function from the `weave` module to fetch the data from the URL specified in the `input` property of the argument object. If the data is still loading, the component renders a loading indicator. Otherwise, it renders the `c` component with the parsed JSON data.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to embed interactive Bokeh plots in a React application. By passing a URL to the `m` function, developers can easily render Bokeh plots without having to manually load the Bokeh library or manage the lifecycle of the plot elements.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and what does this specific file do?\n- The code in this file is a component that renders Bokeh visualizations based on a JSON input. The purpose of the `weave` project is not specified in this code snippet.\n\n2. What version of Bokeh is being used in this code?\n- The default version of Bokeh being used in this code is 2.2.3, but it can be changed by passing a different version number as the first argument to the `a` function.\n\n3. How does the component handle cases where the Bokeh JSON input is not provided or cannot be loaded?\n- If the Bokeh JSON input is not provided or cannot be loaded, the component will render a message indicating that the content was not found. This message can be customized by passing in `notFoundElements` as a prop to the component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/frontend/assets/Component.74cdf409.md"}}],["160",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/frontend/assets/Component.8ef8c231.js.map)\n\nThe code in this file defines a React functional component called `PanelHTML` that renders an HTML file within an iframe.

The `input` property of the props is used to retrieve the URL of the HTML file using the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook, which is also defined in another file. If the URL is still loading, the component returns a `WandbLoader` component, which is imported from the `@wandb/weave/common/components` package. If the URL is null, the component returns a simple `div` element with a dash. Otherwise, the component returns an `iframe` element with the `src` attribute set to the retrieved URL. The `sandbox` attribute is set to allow the iframe to run scripts and access resources from the same origin as the parent document. The `style` attribute sets the border, height, and width of the iframe to 0, 100%, and 100%, respectively.\n\nThis component is likely used in the larger project to display HTML files that are generated as part of the project's output. The `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook is used to retrieve the URL of the HTML file from the project's artifacts, which are likely stored in a database or file system. The `WandbLoader` component is used to display a loading spinner while the URL is being retrieved.

The `input` property is an object that contains information about the HTML card to be created. Specifically, it contains a `directUrl` property that represents the URL of the HTML file to be displayed in the card, and a `loading` property that indicates whether the card is currently loading.\n\nThe function first extracts the `directUrl` and `loading` properties from the `input` object using the `n` function imported from `index.e2c913f5.js`. If the `loading` property is true, the function returns a loading spinner using the `createElement` function from the `W` module. If the `directUrl` property is null, the function returns a div element with a dash. Otherwise, the function returns an iframe element with the `src` attribute set to the `directUrl` property, and with sandboxing enabled to prevent malicious code from executing. The iframe is also given a title and a `data-test-weave-id` attribute for testing purposes.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to display HTML files in a card format.

The input object contains a \"type\" property that specifies the programming language of the code snippet, and a \"file\" property that contains the actual code. The function first creates a reference to a DOM element using the \"useRef\" hook, which will be used to highlight the code syntax. It then uses the \"useEffect\" hook to call a function that highlights the element when it is rendered.\n\nNext, the function creates a memoized object called \"x\" using the \"useMemo\" hook. This object is created by calling a function called \"T\" with the \"file\" property of the input object as a parameter. The \"T\" function is defined in another file and returns an object with two properties: \"loading\" and \"result\". The \"loading\" property is a boolean that indicates whether the code is still being loaded, and the \"result\" property is the actual code.\n\nThe function then creates another memoized object called \"s\" by calling the \"g\" function with the \"x\" object as a parameter.

The \"y\" function is defined in another file and returns an object with several properties related to truncation, including the length of the longest truncated line and the total number of truncated lines.\n\nIf the code is still loading, the function returns a \"div\" element with no content. Otherwise, it creates several variables based on the properties of the \"a\" object and the \"type\" property of the input object. It then returns a \"div\" element with three child elements: a warning message if any lines were truncated to fit within a certain character limit, a warning message if the code was truncated to fit within a certain number of lines, and a \"pre\" element containing the code snippet with syntax highlighting.\n\nThe file also exports another function called \"w\", which takes an input object and returns a React element. This function simply creates a new object with a \"file\" property that is equal to the \"file\" property of the input object, and passes it to the \"F\" function as a parameter. If the size of the code snippet is greater than a certain limit, the function returns a warning message instead of the code snippet.\n\nOverall, this file provides a reusable React component for rendering code snippets with syntax highlighting and optional truncation.

The purpose of this code is to define the syntax highlighting rules for the `azcli` language. \n\nThe code defines two objects: `e` and `t`. `e` contains an object called `comments` which defines the comment syntax for the language. In this case, the comment syntax is defined as a line comment starting with `#`. `t` contains the default token for the language, which is `keyword`, and the token postfix, which is `.azcli`. \n\nThe `tokenizer` object is the main part of the code and defines the rules for tokenizing the language. The `root` array contains an array of rules for the tokenizer. The first rule is to include comments, which are defined in the `@comment` rule. The second rule matches any whitespace, followed by an optional `-` or `+` character, followed by one or more non-whitespace and non-`#` characters. This rule is used to match command-line arguments. The third rule is similar to the second rule, but it only matches `-` characters followed by one or more non-whitespace and non-`#` characters. This rule is used to match command-line options. \n\nThe `type` array contains rules for tokenizing types in the language. The first rule is to include comments, which are defined in the `@comment` rule. The second rule matches any `-` character, followed by one or more non-whitespace and non-`#` characters. This rule is used to match types. The third rule matches any `@` character, followed by one or more non-whitespace and non-`#` characters. This rule is used to match variables. \n\nThe `comment` array contains rules for tokenizing comments in the language. The only rule in this array matches any `#` character, followed by any number of characters until the end of the line. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger `weave` project to provide syntax highlighting for the `azcli` language. For example, if a user is editing an `azcli` file in the `weave` project's code editor, this code will be used to highlight the syntax of the file. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { conf, language } from 'weave/azcli';\n\n// Use the configuration object to set up the syntax highlighting rules\nmonaco.languages.setLanguageConfiguration('azcli', conf);\n\n// Register the language with the code editor\nmonaco.languages.register({ id: 'azcli' });\n\n// Register the syntax highlighting rules with the code editor\nmonaco.languages.setMonarchTokensProvider('azcli', language);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The Monaco Editor is a popular browser-based code editor used in projects like Visual Studio Code.\n\nThe code consists of two main objects: `conf` and `language`. The `conf` object contains configuration settings for the Java language, such as word patterns, comments, brackets, auto-closing pairs, surrounding pairs, and folding markers. These settings help the editor understand how to tokenize and process the Java code.\n\nThe `language` object defines the syntax highlighting rules for Java, including keywords, operators, symbols, and tokenizer rules. The keywords array contains a list of Java keywords like `abstract`, `continue`, `for`, etc. The operators array contains a list of Java operators like `=`, `>`, `<`, etc. The tokenizer rules define how the editor should tokenize the Java code and apply appropriate syntax highlighting.\n\nFor example, the tokenizer rules include patterns for whitespace, comments, strings, numbers, and annotations. Each rule has a regular expression pattern and a corresponding token type. When the editor encounters a match for a pattern, it assigns the token type to that part of the code, which helps in applying syntax highlighting.\n\nHere's a sample of how the tokenizer rules are defined:\n\n```javascript\ntokenizer: {\n    root: [\n        // identifiers and keywords\n        [\n            /[a-zA-Z_$][\\w$]*/,\n            {\n                cases: {\n                    '@keywords': { token: 'keyword.$0' },\n                    '@default': 'identifier'\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        // whitespace\n        { include: '@whitespace' },\n        // ...\n    ],\n    whitespace: [\n        [/[ \\t\\r\\n]+/, ''],\n        [/\\/\\*\\*(?!\\/)/, 'comment.doc', '@javadoc'],\n        [/\\/\\*/, 'comment', '@comment'],\n        [/\\/\\/.*$/, 'comment']\n    ],\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, this code provides the necessary configuration and syntax highlighting rules for the Java language in the Monaco Editor, enabling developers to write and edit Java code with proper syntax highlighting and code folding support.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code is a configuration file for the Java language support in the Monaco Editor, a popular web-based code editor. It defines various language features such as keywords, operators, and tokenization rules to enable syntax highlighting and other language-specific features in the editor.\n\n2. **What are the main components of the `conf` and `language` objects?**\n\n   The `conf` object contains configuration settings for the Java language, such as word patterns, comments, brackets, auto-closing pairs, surrounding pairs, and folding markers. The `language` object defines the default token, token postfix, keywords, operators, regular expressions for symbols, escapes, digits, and the main tokenizer for the Java language.\n\n3. **How does the tokenizer work in this code?**\n\n   The tokenizer is defined in the `language` object and is responsible for breaking the input code into tokens based on the specified rules. It has several states, such as `root`, `whitespace`, `comment`, `javadoc`, `string`, and `multistring`, each with its own set of matching patterns and actions. The tokenizer transitions between these states based on the input code and applies the appropriate token types for syntax highlighting and other language-specific features.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/frontend/assets/java.969478ce.js.md"}}],["199",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/frontend/assets/java.969478ce.js)\n\nThe code provided is a configuration file for the Java programming language in the Weave project.

The purpose of this file is to define the syntax highlighting rules for JavaScript code in the editor. \n\nThe file imports the configuration and language definitions for TypeScript and exports them as the configuration and language definitions for JavaScript. This is because JavaScript and TypeScript share many of the same syntax rules, and TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. \n\nThe language definition includes a list of keywords, type keywords, operators, symbols, and escape characters used in JavaScript code. These are used by the tokenizer to identify and highlight different parts of the code. \n\nFor example, the keyword \"if\" is included in the list of keywords. When the tokenizer encounters the word \"if\" in the code, it will apply the appropriate styling to highlight it as a keyword. \n\nOverall, this file is an important component of the Monaco Editor's ability to provide syntax highlighting for JavaScript code. It allows developers to more easily read and understand their code by visually distinguishing different parts of the code based on their function. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as monaco from 'monaco-editor';\nimport javascript from 'weave/javascript';\n\nmonaco.languages.register({ id: 'javascript' });\n\nmonaco.languages.setMonarchTokensProvider('javascript', javascript);\n\nconst editor = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById('container'), {\n  value: 'function add(a, b) {\\n  return a + b;\\n}',\n  language: 'javascript'\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `javascript` language definition is imported from the `weave` project and registered with the Monaco Editor. The `setMonarchTokensProvider` method is used to set the syntax highlighting rules for the `javascript` language. Finally, a new editor instance is created with the `language` option set to `'javascript'`.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It imports a `conf` object from another module called `typescript`, and then exports it as is. This suggests that the `weave` project's implementation of JavaScript is based on TypeScript, and that this module is simply providing the TypeScript configuration options for the JavaScript implementation.\n\nThe `language` object contains information about the JavaScript language itself. It defines a set of keywords, operators, symbols, and escape characters that are used in JavaScript code. This object is exported as is, and can be used by other modules in the `weave` project to tokenize and parse JavaScript code.\n\nHere is an example of how this module might be used in the larger `weave` project:\n\n```javascript\nimport { language } from 'weave/javascript';\n\nconst code = 'const x = 42;';\nconst tokens = [];\n\n// Tokenize the code using the language information from the `javascript` module\nconst tokenizer = language.tokenizer(code, 0);\nlet token = tokenizer.next();\nwhile (!token.done) {\n  tokens.push(token.value);\n  token = tokenizer.next();\n}\n\nconsole.log(tokens);\n// Output: [{ startIndex: 0, scopes: 'source.js', type: '', value: 'const' },\n//          { startIndex: 6, scopes: 'source.js', type: '', value: 'x' },\n//          { startIndex: 8, scopes: 'source.js', type: '', value: '=' },\n//          { startIndex: 10, scopes: 'source.js', type: '', value: '42' },\n//          { startIndex: 12, scopes: 'source.js', type: '', value: ';' }]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `language` object is used to tokenize a simple JavaScript code snippet. The `tokenizer` function from the `language` object is called with the code and a starting index of 0. The resulting tokens are then pushed into an array and logged to the console. This demonstrates how the `weave` project can use the language information provided by this module to parse and analyze JavaScript code.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It provides syntax highlighting and auto-completion for the M3 programming language. The code defines two main objects: `conf` and `language`.\n\nThe `conf` object contains configuration settings for the M3 language, such as block comments, brackets, and auto-closing pairs. These settings help the editor understand how to handle specific language constructs, like matching opening and closing brackets or auto-closing quotes.\n\nThe `language` object defines the syntax of the M3 language, including keywords, reserved constant names, reserved type names, operators, relations, delimiters, and symbols. It also defines a tokenizer, which is responsible for breaking the input code into tokens and assigning appropriate classes to them, such as 'keyword', 'number', 'string', etc. This information is used by the editor to provide syntax highlighting and other language-specific features.\n\nHere's an example of how the tokenizer works:\n\n```javascript\ntokenizer: {\n    root: [\n        // Identifiers and keywords\n        [/_\\w*/, 'invalid'],\n        [\n            /[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*/,\n            {\n                cases: {\n                    '@keywords': { token: 'keyword.$0' },\n                    '@reservedConstNames': { token: 'constant.reserved.$0' },\n                    '@reservedTypeNames': { token: 'type.reserved.$0' },\n                    '@default': 'identifier'\n                }\n            }\n        ],\n        // Whitespace\n        { include: '@whitespace' },\n        // ...\n    ],\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the tokenizer first checks for invalid identifiers (starting with an underscore), then checks for valid identifiers and keywords. If a token matches a keyword, it is assigned the 'keyword' class, and so on for reserved constant names and reserved type names. If it doesn't match any of these, it is considered a regular identifier.\n\nBy defining the syntax and configuration for the M3 language, this code allows the Monaco Editor to provide a better editing experience for developers working with M3 code.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\n\n   This code defines the configuration and language settings for the M3 programming language in the Monaco Editor, a popular web-based code editor.\n\n2. **What are the main components of the `conf` and `language` objects?**\n\n   The `conf` object contains settings for comments, brackets, and auto-closing pairs, while the `language` object defines the default token, token postfix, keywords, reserved names, operators, relations, delimiters, and tokenizer rules for the M3 language.\n\n3. **How are the tokenizer rules defined in the `language` object?**\n\n   The tokenizer rules are defined as a series of regular expressions and actions in the `tokenizer` property of the `language` object.

The `Node` class is a generic base class for different types of nodes in the DAG, such as `OutputNode`, `VarNode`, `ConstNode`, and `VoidNode`. Each node type has specific attributes and methods for handling their respective roles in the DAG.\n\nThe `Op` class represents an operation in the DAG, with a name and a dictionary of input nodes. The `OutputNode` class represents the output of an operation, containing a reference to the `Op` object and the output type.

In Weave, a Node is essentially a function, and if there are no variables in the Node's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), the node can be executed. This code allows for passing a Node of type `Node[Function[..., int]]` in positions that expect an `int`. When this type of call is detected, the code automatically inserts an `.execute()` operation.\n\nThe `update_input_types` function in this file is used to update the input types of an operation based on the expected input types. It takes in an optional `op_input_type` argument, which is an instance of `op_args.OpArgs`, and a dictionary of `actual_input_types`. If `op_input_type` is not an instance of `op_args.OpNamedArgs`, the function simply returns `actual_input_types`. Otherwise, it compares the expected input types in `op_input_type` to the actual input types in `actual_input_types` and updates the input types accordingly. If the actual input type is a `types.Function` and the expected input type is not callable and not an instance of `types.Function`, the function sets the input type to the output type of the function.\n\nThis code is important for the Weave project because it allows for more seamless integration of Nodes into the larger project. By automatically inserting `.execute()` operations when appropriate, it simplifies the process of executing Nodes and makes the code more readable. The `update_input_types` function is also important for ensuring that the input types of operations are correctly updated based on the expected input types, which is crucial for the proper functioning of the project. \n\nExample usage of the automatic function calling feature:\n\n```\nfrom weave import Node\n\n# Define a Node that takes in two integers and returns their sum\n@Node\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    return a + b\n\n# Define another Node that takes in an integer and returns its square\n@Node\ndef square(a: int) -> int:\n    return a ** 2\n\n# Use the Nodes to perform a calculation\nresult = add(square(2), 3).execute()\nprint(result) # Output: 7\n```\n\nIn this example, the `square` Node is automatically executed when it is passed as an argument to the `add` Node, which expects two integers. The resulting calculation is then executed using the `.execute()` method.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this class is to provide a way to weave together multiple lists into a single list. The `Weave` class has a single method called `weave_lists` which takes in an arbitrary number of lists and returns a single list that contains all the elements from the input lists, woven together in a specific way.\n\nThe `weave_lists` method works by first finding the length of the longest input list.

A tag getter is an operation that retrieves a tag from an object. The first function, `is_tag_getter`, is a heuristic that checks if an operation is a single tag getter or a mapped tag getter. If an operation is either of these, it returns `True`. The second function, `_is_single_tag_getter`, checks if an operation is a single tag getter. It does this by checking if the operation name starts with \"tag-\" or \"get_tag-\", and if the input type is an `OpNamedArgs` object that contains an argument called \"obj\" that is an instance of `TaggedValueType`. The third function, `_is_mapped_tag_getter`, checks if an operation is a mapped tag getter. It does this by checking if the operation name starts with \"mapped_tag-\" or \"mapped_get_tag-\", and if the input type is an `OpNamedArgs` object that contains an argument called \"obj\" that is an instance of `List` whose object type is an instance of `TaggedValueType`.\n\nThese functions are used in the larger project to identify tag getter operations. This information can be used to optimize the execution of the operations, since tag getters are often called repeatedly during the execution of a program. For example, if a tag getter operation is identified, the program can cache the result of the operation so that it doesn't need to be called again if the same tag is requested later. \n\nHere is an example of how these functions might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nfrom weave import op_def\n\n# Define an operation that retrieves a tag from an object\nclass GetTagOp(op_def.OpDef):\n    name = \"get_tag\"\n    input_type = op_args.OpNamedArgs({\"obj\": tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType})\n    output_type = types.String\n\n# Check if the operation is a tag getter\nif is_tag_getter(GetTagOp):\n    print(\"This operation is a tag getter\")\nelse:\n    print(\"This operation is not a tag getter\")\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

A tagged value is a value that has been associated with one or more tags, which are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the value. The function takes in several arguments, including the key of the tag to get, the type of the tag to get, and the type of the tagged value to get the tag from. It returns an operation that can be used to retrieve the value of the specified tag from a tagged value.\n\nThe function creates two operations: a regular tag getter operation and a vectorized tag getter operation specifically for `ArrowWeaveList`. The regular tag getter operation takes in a single input, which is a tagged value that contains the tag to retrieve. The output type of the operation is determined by the type of the tag being retrieved. The vectorized tag getter operation takes in an `ArrowWeaveList` object, which is a list of tagged values that can be processed in parallel. The output type of the vectorized operation is also determined by the type of the tag being retrieved.\n\nThe operations are created using the `decorator_op.op` decorator, which is used to define operations in the `weave` project. The decorator takes in several arguments, including the name of the operation, the input and output types of the operation, and the function that implements the operation. The function takes in the input data and returns the output data.\n\nOverall, this function is useful for retrieving specific tags from tagged values in the `weave` project. It provides a convenient way to extract additional information from values and process them in parallel using `ArrowWeaveList`.

Tagged values are objects in the Python runtime that are associated with a set of tags. The implementation uses a memory mapping from the Python id of an object to a dictionary of tags, which is implemented in `tag_store.py`. The `TaggedValueType` class has custom logic to determine if an object is a tagged value and special assignability rules. When serializing a tagged value to disk, the tags are also serialized, which is handled by the type class and the mappers.\n\nThe main advantage of this system is that op resolvers can operate entirely agnostic to tags, without mutating the underlying Python object. However, the op resolver can still access the tags using the `find_tag` function in `tag_store.py`. This is used by tag getters. Ops can add tags using the `add_tags` function in `tag_store.py`, which is used by tag setters (like list-tagCheckpoint). Core language ops need to operate on tags directly (for example, list-concat), and ops that are weavifiable will get all internal tag handling for free.\n\nThe `TaggedValueType` class is a custom Weave Type used to represent tagged values. It has methods to handle the assignment of types, checking if an object is an instance of the type, and saving/loading instances. The `TaggedValueMapper` class is responsible for mapping tagged values to and from Python objects. It has two subclasses, `TaggedValueToPy` and `TaggedValueFromPy`, which handle the conversion of tagged values to Python dictionaries and vice versa, respectively.\n\nAn example usage of this code in the larger project would be when an op resolver needs to access the tags of an object. It can use the `find_tag` function from `tag_store.py` to retrieve the tags, and then perform the necessary operations on the object and its tags.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: How does the TaggedValueType handle nested TaggedValue types?\n   **Answer**: The TaggedValueType handles nested TaggedValue types by merging the tags of the inner TaggedValueType with the outer one and updating the value type accordingly. This is done in the `__post_init__` method of the TaggedValueType class.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the TaggedValueType handle UnionType values?\n   **Answer**: The TaggedValueType handles UnionType values by creating a new union type with each member of the original union wrapped in a TaggedValueType with the same tag. This is done in the `_assignment_form` method of the TaggedValueType class.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the TaggedValueMapper work with serialization and deserialization of tagged values?\n   **Answer**: The TaggedValueMapper uses separate serializers for tags and values. The TaggedValueToPy class serializes the tags and values separately and combines them into a dictionary, while the TaggedValueFromPy class deserializes the tags and values separately and then adds the tags to the deserialized value using the `tag_store.add_tags` function.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/language_features/tagging/tagged_value_type.md"}}],["273",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/language_features/tagging/tagged_value_type_helpers.py)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a function called `push_down_tags_from_container_type_to_element_type` that takes a `container_type` parameter of type `types.Type` and returns a new `types.Type` object. The purpose of this function is to \"push down\" tags from a container type to its element type. \n\nThe function first checks if the `container_type` is an instance of `tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType`. If it is not, the function simply returns the `container_type`. If it is, the function checks if the `container_type` is a list. If it is not a list, the function raises a `ValueError`. \n\nIf the `container_type` is a list, the function extracts the tag type and value type from the `container_type`. If the `container_type` has an object type that is also a `tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType`, the function creates a new tag type by merging the property types of the `container_type` and the object type. Otherwise, the function uses the tag type of the `container_type`. The function then creates a new `tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType` object with the new tag type and the value type of the `container_type`. Finally, the function returns a new `container_outer_type` object with the new `new_inner_type`.\n\nThe `is_tagged_value_type` function is a simple helper function that returns `True` if the input `t` is an instance of `tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType` or if it is a `types.Const` object with a `val_type` that is a `tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType`.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger `weave` project to manipulate and transform data structures that include tags. For example, if the project includes a data structure that represents a list of items, where each item has a tag and a value, this function can be used to push down the tags from the list level to the item level. This can be useful for downstream processing that requires the tags to be associated with the individual items rather than the list as a whole. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport weave\n\n# Define a tagged list type\ntag_type = weave.tagged_value_type.TagType({\"color\": types.String()})\nlist_type = types.List(tag_type)\n\n# Create a sample list\nsample_list = list_type([{\"color\": \"red\", \"value\": 1}, {\"color\": \"blue\", \"value\": 2}])\n\n# Push down the tags to the individual items\nnew_list_type = weave.push_down_tags_from_container_type_to_element_type(list_type)\nnew_sample_list = new_list_type([{\"color\": \"red\", \"value\": 1}, {\"color\": \"blue\", \"value\": 2}])\n\n# Check that the new list type has the correct structure\nassert isinstance(new_list_type, types.List)\nassert isinstance(new_list_type.object_type, tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType)\nassert isinstance(new_list_type.object_type.tag, types.TypedDict)\nassert \"color\" in new_list_type.object_type.tag.property_types\n\n# Check that the new sample list has the correct structure\nassert isinstance(new_sample_list, types.List)\nassert isinstance(new_sample_list[0], tagged_value_type.TaggedValueType)\nassert isinstance(new_sample_list[0].tag, types.TypedDict)\nassert \"color\" in new_sample_list[0].tag.property_types\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

Otherwise, it returns `NoneType()`. This function is useful for retrieving the tag associated with a tagged value type, which can be used for further processing or validation.\n\nHere is an example usage of `op_get_tag_type_resolver`:\n\n```\nfrom weave.tagged_value_type import TaggedValueType\nfrom weave import weave_types as types\n\n# create a tagged value type with tag \"my_tag\"\nmy_tagged_value = TaggedValueType(types.Int(), \"my_tag\")\n\n# get the tag associated with the tagged value type\ntag = op_get_tag_type_resolver(my_tagged_value)  # returns \"my_tag\"\n```\n\nThe second function, `op_make_type_tagged_resolver`, takes in a `types.Type` object and a `tag_type` object and returns a new `TaggedValueType` object with the given `tag_type` and the original `obj_type`.

This operation is useful when a user wants to retrieve the tag type associated with a particular object type. For example, if a user has an object of type \"Person\" and wants to know the tag type associated with it, they can use this operation to retrieve it. \n\nThe second operation, \"op_make_type_tagged\", takes an object type and a tag type as input and returns a new object type that is tagged with the given tag type.

The function returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the result of the operation should be forced to `None`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to determine whether or not an operation should return `None` if one of its inputs is `None`.

The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and configurable logging system that can be used throughout the project. \n\nThe `LogFormat` enum defines two possible formats for log messages: \"pretty\" and \"datadog\". The former is a human-readable format, while the latter is a JSON format that is compatible with the Datadog logging service. \n\nThe `LogSettings` dataclass is used to store the desired log format and log level for a particular logger. \n\nThe `indent_logs`, `increment_indent`, `reset_indent`, and `get_indent` functions are used to keep track of the indentation level for log messages. This is useful for nested log messages, where it can be helpful to visually distinguish between messages at different levels of nesting. \n\nThe `IndentFilter` class is a logging filter that adds an `indent` attribute to log records. This attribute contains a string of spaces that corresponds to the current indentation level. \n\nThe `get_logdir`, `get_logfile_path`, and `default_log_filename` functions are used to determine the path to the log file(s) that will be used for logging. If the log directory or file cannot be created or written to, a warning message is printed and logging to the file is disabled. \n\nThe `env_log_level` function reads the `WEAVE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to determine the desired log level. If this variable is not set, the default log level is \"ERROR\". If the `WEAVE_SERVER_ENABLE_LOGGING` environment variable is set, the default log level is \"INFO\". \n\nThe `silence_mpl` function disables logging for the Matplotlib library. \n\nThe `set_global_log_level` function is unused. \n\nThe `print_handlers` and `print_all_handlers` functions are used for debugging and print information about the logging handlers that are currently in use. \n\nThe `WeaveJSONEncoder` class is a JSON encoder that is used to encode log messages in the Datadog format. \n\nThe `setup_handler` function is used to configure a logging handler with the desired log format and level. \n\nThe `enable_stream_logging` function is the main entry point for configuring logging. It takes several optional arguments that specify the desired log settings for different loggers. If a logger is not specified, the root logger is used. If a log setting is not specified, the default log settings are used. \n\nThe `configure_logger` function is called to configure logging when the module is imported. It sets the log level for the root logger, removes any existing stream handlers, and then calls `enable_stream_logging` to add the desired logging handlers. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and configurable logging system that can be used throughout the Weave project. It supports both human-readable and JSON log formats, and can log to both files and standard output. The indentation support and ability to configure different log settings for different loggers makes it easy to use and customize.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The Types module likely contains various classes and data structures that are used throughout the larger project, and this script provides a visual representation of how they are organized and related to each other.\n\nThe script first installs two Python packages, `pylint` and `pygraphviz`, which are required for the `pyreverse` tool to function properly. It then runs the `pyreverse` command with various options to generate a PNG image of the class hierarchy for the Types module. The options include `-p weave` to specify the project name, `-my` to include only modules in the current directory, `-o png` to output the diagram as a PNG image, `-k` to group classes by package, and `--ignore mappers.py,mappers_arrow.py,mappers_python.py` to exclude certain modules from the diagram. The `-s 0` option sets the minimum depth of the diagram to 0, meaning that all classes in the Types module will be included.\n\nThis script can be useful for developers who are working on the Types module or other parts of the larger project that depend on it. By providing a visual representation of the class hierarchy, it can help developers understand how different classes are related to each other and how changes to one class may affect others.

The `cls` argument is the class that the new instance should be created from, and the `kwargs` argument is a dictionary of keyword arguments that will be used to initialize the new instance.\n\nThe `make` function first imports two modules from the `weave` package: `weave_types` and `weave_internal`. The `weave_types` module contains functions and classes that define the types used in the weave project, while the `weave_internal` module contains internal functions and classes that are not meant to be used directly by users of the weave project.\n\nThe `make` function then creates a new dictionary called `args` that maps each key in the `kwargs` dictionary to a new key that is the result of calling the `to_weavejs_typekey` function from the `weave_types` module on the original key. This is done to convert the keys from Python-style names to JavaScript-style names, which are used in the weave project. The `args` dictionary also includes a new key called `\"name\"`, which is set to a new `ConstNode` object created by calling the `make_const_node` function from the `weave_internal` module. This `ConstNode` object represents the name of the new instance and is of type `String`.\n\nFinally, the `make` function returns a new `OutputNode` object created by calling the `make_output_node` function from the `weave_internal` module. This `OutputNode` object represents the new instance of the `Type` class and is of type `TypeType`. The `make_output_node` function takes three arguments: the type of the output node, the name of the operation that creates the output node, and the dictionary of arguments that will be used to initialize the output node.\n\nThe last line of the code sets the `_make` attribute of the `Type` class to the `make` function. This allows users of the weave project to create new instances of the `Type` class by calling the `_make` method on the class.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way for users of the weave project to create new instances of the `Type` class using a simple and flexible interface. Here is an example of how the `make` function might be used:\n\n```\nfrom weave import Type\n\n# Create a new instance of the Type class with some initial values\nmy_type = Type._make(foo=42, bar=\"hello\")\n\n# Use the new instance in some way\nresult = my_type.do_something()\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

Why is the `make` function defined with a default value of an empty dictionary for the `kwargs` parameter?\n- This is likely done to allow for the `kwargs` parameter to be optional when calling the `make` function, and to avoid potential errors if no arguments are passed in.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `TODO` comments in the code?\n- The first `TODO` comment is asking if the `make` function should accept `*args` and `**kwargs`, while the second `TODO` comment is asking if the `Op` should be defined as a native Python op.

The type_ argument is the type of the object being mapped, mapper is a function that maps the object, artifact is the artifact being mapped, and path is the path to the artifact. The class has a result_type method that raises a NotImplementedError and an apply method that takes in an object and returns either a dictionary or any other type.\n\nThe make_mapper function takes in a map_fn argument, which is a function that maps an object.

The mapper function calls the map_fn function with the same arguments and returns the result.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to map objects to a specific format or structure. The Mapper class can be subclassed to create custom mappers for different types of objects. The make_mapper function can be used to create a new mapper function that uses a specific map_fn function. For example, if we have a list of objects that we want to map to a dictionary format, we can create a new mapper function using make_mapper and pass in a map_fn function that maps each object to a dictionary.

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data that provides efficient data interchange between systems. The main purpose of this code is to facilitate the conversion of data between Python and other languages or systems that use Apache Arrow.\n\nThe code defines several classes that inherit from the base `mappers_python` classes, such as `TypedDictToArrowStruct`, `ObjectToArrowStruct`, `StringToArrow`, and others. These classes implement the `result_type` method, which returns the corresponding Arrow data type for the given Python object, and the `apply` method, which converts the Python object to its Arrow representation.\n\nThe `UnionToArrowUnion` class handles the conversion of Python union types to Arrow union types, and the `ArrowUnionToUnion` class handles the reverse conversion. These classes provide methods to get the Arrow type code for a given Python type, and to get the mapper for a given type code.\n\nThe `map_to_arrow_` and `map_from_arrow_` functions are used to create mappers for converting between Python objects and Arrow data structures.

This is useful when working with tagged values, as it allows the `StringToArrow` mapper to return a dictionary type instead of a string type for the result type.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `UnionToArrowUnion` class handle nullable types?\n   **Answer**: The `UnionToArrowUnion` class checks if the union type is nullable by looking for a `types.NoneType` member in its `_member_mappers`. If the union is nullable and has only one non-nullable member, it returns the result type of that member with the nullable flag set to `True`. If the union is not nullable or has more than one non-nullable member, it creates a dense union type with the result types of all non-nullable members.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `DefaultToArrow` class handle different types when mapping to Arrow types?\n   **Answer**: The `DefaultToArrow` class checks the name of the input type and returns the corresponding Arrow type based on a hardcoded mapping.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to convert Weave-specific objects into their Python equivalents, which can then be used in other parts of the project or in external applications.\n\nThe `RefToPyRef` class is a mapper that converts a `Ref` object into a Python reference. The `FunctionToPyFunction` class maps a `Function` object to a Python function. The `ObjectToPyDict` class maps an `ObjectType` to a Python dictionary. The `UnionToPyUnion` class maps a `UnionType` to a Python union. The `TaggedValueToPy` class maps a `TaggedValueType` to a Python dictionary with tags.

The purpose of these functions is to provide a way to convert data from one format to another, allowing for interoperability between different parts of the larger Weave project.\n\nThe `map_to_python` function takes a `weave_types.Type` object, an `artifact_base.Artifact` object, and optional `path` and `mapper_options` arguments. It returns a `mappers.Mapper` object. The purpose of this function is to map data from a Weave artifact to a Python object. The `type_` argument specifies the type of the Python object to be created, while the `artifact` argument contains the data to be mapped. The `path` argument is used to specify a path within the artifact to the data to be mapped, while the `mapper_options` argument can be used to specify additional options for the mapping process.\n\nThe `map_from_python` function is similar to `map_to_python`, but is used to map data from a Python object to a Weave artifact. It takes the same arguments as `map_to_python`, but returns a `mappers.Mapper` object that maps data from a Python object to a Weave artifact.\n\nBoth functions are designed to work with other parts of the Weave project, such as the `mappers_python_def` module, which contains the actual implementation of the mapping process. By separating the mapping functions from the implementation, the code avoids circular dependencies and allows for greater flexibility in how the mapping process is implemented.\n\nHere is an example of how these functions might be used in the larger Weave project:\n\n```\nimport weave\nimport json\n\n# Create a Weave artifact containing some data\ndata = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\nartifact = weave.artifact_base.Artifact(json.dumps(data))\n\n# Map the data to a Python object\nperson = weave.map_to_python(weave_types.Type(\"Person\"), artifact)\n\n# Modify the Python object\nperson[\"age\"] += 1\n\n# Map the modified object back to a Weave artifact\nmodified_artifact = weave.map_from_python(weave_types.Type(\"Person\"), person)\n\n# Print the modified artifact\nprint(modified_artifact.data)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes a `TypedDict` object, a `mapper` object, an `artifact` object, and an optional `path` argument. The `mapper` object is used to map the properties of the `TypedDict` object to the appropriate format. The `artifact` object is used to store the mapped data.

It takes a Python list object, a `mapper` object, an `artifact` object, and an optional `path` argument. The `mapper` object is used to map the elements of the list to the appropriate format. The `artifact` object is used to store the mapped data.

It takes a Python reference object, a `mapper` object, an `artifact` object, and an optional `path` argument. The `mapper` object is not used in this case, as the reference object is not mapped to a different format. The `artifact` object is used to store the reference.\n\nThe `ConstMapper` class is used to map a Python constant object to a format that can be stored or transmitted. It takes a Python constant object, a `mapper` object, an `artifact` object, and an optional `path` argument. The `mapper` object is used to map the value of the constant object to the appropriate format. The `artifact` object is used to store the mapped data. The `path` argument is used to keep track of the path to the current property being mapped.\n\nThese classes are used in the larger `weave` project to provide a way to map Python objects to a format that can be stored or transmitted.

The module defines a `memo` decorator that can be applied to any function to enable memoization. \n\nThe `memo` decorator works by creating a context in which the function's results can be stored and retrieved. The context is implemented using the `contextvars` module, which provides a way to store and retrieve values that are local to a particular execution context, such as a thread or coroutine. \n\nThe `memo_storage` context is created using the `contextvars.ContextVar` class, which is a thread-local variable that can be used to store and retrieve values. The `memo_storage` context is initialized to `None` by default, indicating that memoization is not enabled. \n\nThe `memo` decorator works by wrapping the original function with a new function that checks whether memoization is enabled. If memoization is not enabled, the original function is called and its result is returned. If memoization is enabled, the function's arguments are used to generate a key that is used to look up the result in the memoization context. If the result is found, it is returned. If the result is not found, the original function is called, its result is stored in the memoization context, and the result is returned. \n\nThe `memo_storage` context is managed using a context manager, which is created using the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator. The context manager is used to set the memoization context to an empty dictionary when memoization is enabled, and to reset the memoization context to its previous value when memoization is disabled. \n\nThe `NoValue` class is a simple placeholder class that is used to represent the absence of a value. The `NO_VALUE` constant is an instance of this class that is used as a sentinel value in the memoization context to indicate that a particular key has no associated value. \n\nThe `statsd` variable is used to track statistics about the memoization process using the `engine_trace` module. However, the details of this functionality are not provided in this code snippet. \n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides a simple and flexible way to enable memoization for any function in a Python project. Here is an example of how to use the `memo` decorator:\n\n```python\n@memo\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nThis code defines a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number. By applying the `memo` decorator, the function's results will be cached in memory, which will significantly speed up the computation for large values of `n`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `memo` function?\n- The `memo` function is a decorator that caches the result of a function call based on its arguments and stores it in a context variable.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `memo_storage` context manager?\n- The `memo_storage` context manager creates a new empty dictionary and sets it as the value of the `_memo_storage` context variable for the duration of the context. This allows the `memo` function to cache results without interfering with other parts of the code that may use the same context variable.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `NO_VALUE` constant?\n- The `NO_VALUE` constant is a sentinel value used to indicate that a cached result does not exist for a particular set of arguments.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/memo.md"}}],["286",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/node_ref.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains functions for converting between `Node` and `Ref` objects. `Node` objects represent operations in a computation graph, while `Ref` objects represent references to specific values in the graph. The purpose of these functions is to allow for more efficient storage and retrieval of objects in the graph.\n\nThe `node_to_ref` function takes a `Node` object as input and attempts to convert it to a `Ref` object. It does this by checking if the `Node` represents a specific call sequence that can be converted to a `Ref`. Specifically, if the `Node` represents a `get` call followed by one or more `__getitem__` calls, it can be converted to a `Ref`. The `Ref` is constructed using the URI of the `get` call and a list of string keys representing the `__getitem__` calls. If the conversion is successful, the function returns the `Ref` object. Otherwise, it returns `None`.\n\nThe `ref_to_node` function is the inverse of `node_to_ref`. It takes a `Ref` object as input and attempts to convert it to a `Node` object. It does this by constructing a `Node` object that represents the `get` call in the `Ref`, and then applying the `__getitem__` calls in the `Ref` to the `Node`. If the conversion is successful, the function returns the `Node` object. Otherwise, it returns `None`.\n\nThese functions are used when saving objects in the `weave` project. When a user composes objects from values fetched from other objects, the resulting `Node` objects may be converted to `Ref` objects using `node_to_ref`. If the conversion is successful, the object is saved in `Ref` format instead of `Node` format. This allows for more efficient storage and retrieval of objects, since `Ref` objects are more compact and guarantee the existence of the referenced value.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way to represent and manipulate references to values in a computation graph, which is a key component of the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

An `ObjectRecord` has four attributes: `val`, `type`, `branched_from_uri`, and `mutations`. `val` is the object value, `type` is the object type, `branched_from_uri` is the URI of the object that this object was branched from (if any), and `mutations` is a list of `MutationRecord` instances representing the mutations made to this object.\n\nThe `ObjectContext` class defines several methods for adding and looking up objects and mutations. `add_ref` adds a reference to an object to the context. `lookup_ref_val` looks up the value of an object given its URI. `lookup_ref_type` looks up the type of an object given its URI. `add_mutation` adds a mutation to an object given its URI, the URI of the object it was branched from (if any), the new value of the object, a function to create a new type for the object, and the mutation itself. `finish_mutation` finishes a mutation on an object given its URI. `finish_mutations` finishes all mutations in the context.\n\nThe file also defines a context manager `object_context` that creates an `ObjectContext` and sets it as the current context.

These functions use the `pyarrow.compute.less`, `pyarrow.compute.less_equal`, `pyarrow.compute.greater`, and `pyarrow.compute.greater_equal` functions, respectively, to perform the comparisons.\n\nThese operations can be used to manipulate and compare lists of timestamps in a variety of ways. For example, they could be used to round timestamps to the nearest minute or hour, or to compare the timestamps in two different datasets to find overlapping time periods.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into the overall project?\n- This file is part of the `weave` project, but it is unclear from the code alone what the project's purpose is.\n\n2. What is the `ArrowWeaveList` class and how is it used in this code?\n- The `ArrowWeaveList` class is used as an input and output type for several of the functions defined in this code. It is not clear from the code alone what the purpose of this class is or how it is implemented.\n\n3. What is the `arrow_op` decorator and how does it affect the behavior of the functions it decorates?\n- The `arrow_op` decorator is used to define Arrow compute functions that operate on Arrow arrays. It specifies the input and output types of the function, and generates a wrapper function that handles the conversion between Python objects and Arrow arrays.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_arrow/date.md"}}],["303",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_arrow/list_join.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains functions for joining ArrowWeaveLists, which are Arrow tables with additional metadata. The `join_all` function takes a list of ArrowWeaveLists and a join function, and performs a join on all of the lists using the join function. The output is an ArrowWeaveList with a dictionary of lists for each property in the input ArrowWeaveLists. The `join_2` function is similar, but takes two ArrowWeaveLists and two join functions, and performs a join on those two lists. The output is an ArrowWeaveList with a dictionary of lists for each property in the input ArrowWeaveLists.\n\nThe `join_all` function first filters out any null ArrowWeaveLists and pushes down any tags to the individual columns. It then applies the join function to each ArrowWeaveList to get the join key column for each list. It then calls the `join_all_impl_vec` function to perform the join on the ArrowWeaveLists using the join key columns. The `join_all_impl_vec` function first checks if the input list is empty, and if so, returns an empty ArrowWeaveList. Otherwise, it performs the join using the `join_all_impl` function, which ensures that each join key column has the same type, gets the safe join keys, and creates tables for each ArrowWeaveList. It then performs the join on the tables and returns the final join key column and the new ArrowWeaveLists. Finally, it creates a dictionary of lists for each property in the input ArrowWeaveLists and returns an ArrowWeaveList with that dictionary.\n\nThe `join_2` function applies the join functions to the input ArrowWeaveLists to get the join key columns, and then calls the `join_all_impl` function to perform the join on the two ArrowWeaveLists using the join key columns. It then creates a dictionary of lists for each property in the input ArrowWeaveLists and returns an ArrowWeaveList with that dictionary.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way to join ArrowWeaveLists using custom join functions, and return the result as an ArrowWeaveList with a dictionary of lists for each property in the input ArrowWeaveLists. This can be useful for performing complex joins on Arrow tables with additional metadata. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport pyarrow as pa\nfrom weave.arrow_weave_list import ArrowWeaveList\nfrom weave import join_all\n\n# create two ArrowWeaveLists\ntable1 = pa.Table.from_arrays([pa.array([1, 2, 3]), pa.array(['a', 'b', 'c'])], names=['id', 'name'])\ntable2 = pa.Table.from_arrays([pa.array([2, 3, 4]), pa.array(['b', 'c', 'd'])], names=['id', 'name'])\nawl1 = ArrowWeaveList(table1)\nawl2 = ArrowWeaveList(table2)\n\n# define join function\ndef join_fn(row):\n    return row['id']\n\n# join the two ArrowWeaveLists using the join function\nresult = join_all([awl1, awl2], join_fn, outer=False)\n\n# print the result\nprint(result.to_pandas())\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n   id name_x name_y\n0   2      b      b\n1   3      c      c\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `join_all` function and how does it work?\n   \n   `join_all` function is used to join multiple ArrowWeaveLists based on a common join key. It takes a list of ArrowWeaveLists and a join function as input and returns a new ArrowWeaveList that contains the joined data. The function first applies the join function to each ArrowWeaveList to get the join key column, then performs the join operation on the join key column using PyArrow's `join` method. Finally, it returns a new ArrowWeaveList that contains the joined data.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `join_2` function and how does it work?\n\n   `join_2` function is used to join two ArrowWeaveLists based on a common join key. It takes two ArrowWeaveLists and two join functions as input and returns a new ArrowWeaveList that contains the joined data. The function first applies the join functions to each ArrowWeaveList to get the join key columns, then performs the join operation on the join key columns using PyArrow's `join` method. Finally, it returns a new ArrowWeaveList that contains the joined data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `tracer` variable and how is it used in the code?\n\n   The `tracer` variable is used to trace the execution of the code. It is initialized with the `engine_trace.tracer()` method and is used to track the execution of the `join_all` and `join_2` functions. The tracer can be used to generate a trace of the execution of the code, which can be useful for debugging and performance analysis.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_arrow/list_join.md"}}],["304",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_arrow/number.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains a collection of operations that can be performed on ArrowWeaveList objects. ArrowWeaveList is a subclass of ArrowList, which is a subclass of ArrowArray. ArrowWeaveList is a list of Arrow arrays, where each array has the same length and type. The ArrowWeaveList class is used to represent a column of data in a table.\n\nThe module contains a number of functions that perform arithmetic operations on ArrowWeaveList objects. These functions include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. There are also functions for comparing ArrowWeaveList objects, such as greater than, less than, and equal to. Additionally, there are functions for computing statistics on ArrowWeaveList objects, such as average, sum, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation.\n\nThe module also contains functions for converting ArrowWeaveList objects to other data types. For example, there is a function for converting an ArrowWeaveList of numbers to an ArrowWeaveList of strings. There is also a function for converting an ArrowWeaveList of numbers to an ArrowWeaveList of timestamps.\n\nThe functions in this module are designed to be used in conjunction with other modules in the larger project. For example, the functions for computing statistics could be used to generate summary statistics for a table of data. The functions for converting data types could be used to prepare data for visualization or analysis. The functions for performing arithmetic operations and comparisons could be used to filter or transform data. Overall, the `weave` module provides a set of tools for working with ArrowWeaveList objects that are useful for a wide range of data processing tasks.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- The purpose of the `weave` project is not clear from this code alone, but it appears to involve operations on ArrowWeaveLists of various types. This code provides implementations for various arithmetic and comparison operations on ArrowWeaveLists of type Number.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `ArrowWeaveList` and `ArrowWeaveListType` classes?\n- The `ArrowWeaveList` class appears to represent a list of values of a particular type, while the `ArrowWeaveListType` class represents the type of an `ArrowWeaveList`. These classes are used throughout the code to specify input and output types for various operations.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `weave_timestamp` module and how is it used in this code?\n- The `weave_timestamp` module appears to provide some constants and functions related to timestamps. It is used in the `to_timestamp` function to convert a list of numbers to a list of timestamps, adjusting for overflow and underflow as necessary.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_arrow/number.md"}}],["305",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_arrow/obj.py)\n\nThe code in this file defines a function called `arrow_getattr` that is used to get an attribute from an ArrowWeaveList object. ArrowWeaveList is a custom list-like object that is used in the larger project. \n\nThe `arrow_getattr` function is decorated with `arrow_op`, which is a decorator that is used to define operations that can be performed on ArrowWeaveList objects. The decorator takes several arguments, including the name of the operation, the input and output types, and whether or not all arguments are nullable. \n\nThe input type for `arrow_getattr` is a dictionary with two keys: \"self\" and \"name\". \"self\" is an ArrowWeaveList object, and \"name\" is a string representing the name of the attribute to get. The output type is determined dynamically based on the input types. It uses the `getattr_output_type` function from the `primitives_obj` module to determine the output type based on the object type and attribute name. \n\nInside the function, the `_arrow_data` attribute of the ArrowWeaveList object is used to get the data for the attribute with the given name. The `property_types` method is called on the object type to get the type of the attribute. If the object type is optional, the attribute type is also made optional. Finally, a new ArrowWeaveList object is created with the data and type, and returned. \n\nThis function can be used to get attributes from ArrowWeaveList objects in a vectorized way, meaning that it can operate on multiple objects at once. For example, if we have a list of ArrowWeaveList objects and we want to get the \"name\" attribute from each one, we can do the following:\n\n```\nfrom weave.list_ import ArrowWeaveList\nfrom weave import arrow_getattr\n\n# create a list of ArrowWeaveList objects\na = ArrowWeaveList([{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 40}])\nb = ArrowWeaveList([{\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 50}, {\"name\": \"Dave\", \"age\": 60}])\nc = ArrowWeaveList([{\"name\": \"Eve\", \"age\": 20}, {\"name\": \"Frank\", \"age\": 70}])\nlists = [a, b, c]\n\n# get the \"name\" attribute from each object\nnames = arrow_getattr(lists, \"name\")\nprint(names)\n# output: ArrowWeaveList(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave', 'Eve', 'Frank'], type=string)\n```\n\nThis code creates three ArrowWeaveList objects, each with two records containing \"name\" and \"age\" attributes. It then creates a list of these objects and passes it to `arrow_getattr` along with the attribute name \"name\". The function returns a new ArrowWeaveList object containing the \"name\" attribute from all six records.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `arrow_op` decorator used in this code?\n- The `arrow_op` decorator is used to define an Arrow compute function that can be executed on Arrow data structures.\n\n2. What is the expected input and output of the `ArrowWeaveListObject-__vectorizedGetattr__` function?\n- The expected input is an ArrowWeaveList object and a string representing the name of an attribute. The expected output is an ArrowWeaveList object with a type determined by the type of the attribute being accessed.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `all_args_nullable` parameter in the `arrow_op` decorator?\n- The `all_args_nullable` parameter specifies whether all input arguments to the decorated function can be nullable (i.e. have a value of None). In this case, it is set to False, indicating that at least one of the input arguments cannot be nullable.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_arrow/obj.md"}}],["306",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_arrow/ops.py)\n\nThis code imports various modules from the `weave` project, each of which contains functions and classes related to specific data types and operations. \n\nThe `number` module contains functions for working with numerical data types, such as `add()` and `subtract()`.

A smart developer might want to check for any naming conflicts and potentially use aliasing to avoid them.\n\n3. **Is there a specific order in which the modules need to be imported?** \nIt's possible that there is a specific order in which the modules need to be imported for the `weave` project to function properly.

It uses the PyArrow library to perform various operations on ArrowWeaveList objects, which are lists of strings with additional metadata.\n\nThe code defines several input types and output types for the operations, such as ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_STRING_TYPE, ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_BOOLEAN_TYPE, and ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_INT_TYPE. These types are used to define the input and output types of the various operations.\n\nThe main functionality of the code is provided by the arrow_op decorated functions. These functions perform operations such as concatenation, equality checking, substring matching, and various string manipulations (e.g., lowercasing, uppercasing, slicing, replacing, and stripping). Each function takes an ArrowWeaveList object as input and returns a new ArrowWeaveList object as output.\n\nFor example, the `startswith` function checks if each string in the input ArrowWeaveList starts with a given prefix:\n\n```python\n@arrow_op(\n    name=\"ArrowWeaveListString-startsWith\",\n    input_type={\n        \"self\": ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_STRING_TYPE,\n        \"prefix\": types.UnionType(types.String(), ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_STRING_TYPE),\n    },\n    output_type=ARROW_WEAVE_LIST_BOOLEAN_TYPE,\n)\ndef startswith(self, prefix):\n    # ...\n```\n\nThe `join_to_str` function concatenates the strings in an ArrowWeaveList, separated by a given separator:\n\n```python\n@arrow_op(\n    name=\"ArrowWeaveListString-joinToStr\",\n    input_type={\n        \"arr\": ArrowWeaveListType(types.List(types.optional(types.String()))),\n        \"sep\": types.UnionType(types.String(), ArrowWeaveListType(types.String())),\n    },\n    output_type=ArrowWeaveListType(types.String()),\n)\ndef join_to_str(arr, sep):\n    # ...\n```\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to perform operations on lists of strings efficiently and with a consistent API.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `_concatenate_strings` function and how does it handle different input types?\n   **Answer:** The `_concatenate_strings` function is used to concatenate two strings or ArrowWeaveList of strings. It takes two arguments, `left` and `right`, which can be either a string or an ArrowWeaveList of strings. If `right` is `None`, it returns an ArrowWeaveList of nulls with the same length as `left`. If `right` is an ArrowWeaveList, it extracts the underlying arrow data. Finally, it returns a new ArrowWeaveList with the concatenated strings.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `startswith` function work with different types of input for the `prefix` parameter?\n   **Answer:** The `startswith` function checks if the strings in the ArrowWeaveList `self` start with the given `prefix`. If `prefix` is a string, it uses the `pc.starts_with` function from the PyArrow library to perform the check. If `prefix` is an ArrowWeaveList, it iterates through the elements of both `self` and `prefix` and checks if each string in `self` starts with the corresponding string in `prefix`.\n\n3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `join_to_str` function and how does it handle different input types for the `sep` parameter?\n   **Answer:** The `join_to_str` function is used to join the elements of an ArrowWeaveList of strings (`arr`) using a separator (`sep`). The separator can be either a string or an ArrowWeaveList of strings. If `sep` is an ArrowWeaveList, it extracts the underlying arrow data. The function first fills any null values in `arr` with empty strings and then uses the `pc.binary_join` function from the PyArrow library to join the elements using the separator.

The function checks the type of the input node and performs different operations depending on the type. If the node is an `ArtifactAssetType`, the function returns the SHA256 hash of the node. If the node is a `TypedDict`, the function recursively calls itself on each key-value pair in the dictionary and returns a new dictionary with the converted values. If the node is a `List`, the function joins the list elements into a string. \n\nThe `_eq_null_consumer_helper` function takes two `pyarrow` arrays or scalars as input and returns two arrays indicating which elements are null in each input and which elements are null in both inputs. This function is used by the `not_equal` and `equal` functions to handle null values in the input data. \n\nThe `not_equal` function takes two `pyarrow` arrays or scalars as input and returns a new array with boolean values indicating whether the corresponding elements in the input arrays are not equal.

What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how does this file fit into the overall project?\n- This file is part of the `weave` module, which appears to be a collection of Python code for interacting with some external system. The purpose of the module and how this file fits into it is not clear from the code provided.\n\n2. What is the `wb_gql_op_plugin` function and how is it used in this code?\n- `wb_gql_op_plugin` is a function that takes a string template and returns a function that can be used as a decorator for a Python function. The resulting decorated function will generate a GraphQL query string using the template and the input arguments to the function, and then execute the query against the external system. This function is used to define several of the operations in this file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `weave_types` and `wb_domain_types` modules, and how are they used in this code?\n- `weave_types` and `wb_domain_types` appear to be modules containing Python classes that define the structure of data returned by the external system. These classes are used as input and output types for the various operations defined in this file.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_domain/artifact_collection_ops.md"}}],["312",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_domain/artifact_membership_ops.py)\n\nThis code defines GraphQL operations for the `ArtifactCollectionMembership` type in the Weave project. The `gql_prop_op` and `gql_direct_edge_op` functions define GraphQL properties and relationships respectively. The `artifactMembership-link` function defines a custom GraphQL operation that returns a `Link` object.\n\nThe `gql_prop_op` function takes four arguments: the name of the property, the type of the object that the property belongs to, the name of the property in the object, and the type of the property. For example, the first `gql_prop_op` call defines a property called `artifactMembership-versionIndex` of type `Int` for the `ArtifactCollectionMembershipType` object.\n\nThe `gql_direct_edge_op` function takes five arguments: the name of the relationship, the type of the object that the relationship belongs to, the name of the property in the object that represents the relationship, the type of the related object, and a boolean flag indicating whether the relationship is one-to-many. For example, the first `gql_direct_edge_op` call defines a relationship called `artifactMembership-collection` between `ArtifactCollectionMembershipType` and `ArtifactCollectionType`.\n\nThe `artifact_membership_link` function is a custom GraphQL operation that takes an `ArtifactCollectionMembership` object and returns a `Link` object. The `Link` object contains a name and a URL that points to the artifact collection membership. The URL is constructed using information from the `ArtifactCollectionMembership` object.\n\nThis code is used to define the GraphQL schema for the Weave project. The schema defines the types, properties, and relationships that can be queried using GraphQL. The `ArtifactCollectionMembership` type is one of the types in the schema, and the functions in this code define the properties and relationships of that type. The `artifact_membership_link` function is a custom operation that provides additional functionality beyond the standard GraphQL operations. This code is used in conjunction with other code in the Weave project to implement a GraphQL API that can be used to query and manipulate data in the project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?\n- This file is importing modules from `weave.api`, `weave.weave_types`, and `weave.wandb_domain_types`, suggesting that the `weave` project is likely a collection of modules related to machine learning experimentation and tracking.\n2. What do the `gql_prop_op` and `gql_direct_edge_op` functions do?\n- These functions appear to define GraphQL operations for retrieving specific properties and relationships of `ArtifactCollectionMembershipType` objects. The `gql_prop_op` function defines operations for retrieving specific properties, while `gql_direct_edge_op` defines operations for retrieving related objects.\n3. What is the purpose of the `artifact_membership_link` function?\n- This function defines a Weave operation called `artifactMembership-link` that returns a `Link` object. The function uses a GraphQL query to retrieve information about an `ArtifactCollectionMembership` object and constructs a URL based on that information.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_domain/artifact_membership_ops.md"}}],["313",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_domain/artifact_type_ops.py)\n\nThis code file imports various modules from the `weave` project and defines several operations that can be used to query and manipulate data related to artifact types and collections. \n\nThe code is organized into six sections, each of which corresponds to a different type of operation. \n\nThe first section, \"Tag Getters,\" is empty and does not define any operations. \n\nThe second section, \"Root Ops,\" is also empty and does not define any operations. \n\nThe third section, \"Attribute Getters,\" defines a single operation called `op_artifact_type_name`.

This operation is used to define a connection between two types of objects. In this case, the connection is between `ArtifactType` objects and `ArtifactCollection` objects. The operation takes several arguments, including the names of the types being connected, the names of the fields that define the connection, and a dictionary of additional arguments to be passed to the GraphQL query. \n\nThe sixth and final section, \"Non Standard Business Logic Ops,\" defines an operation called `artifact_versions`. This operation takes an `ArtifactType` object as input and returns a list of `ArtifactVersion` objects.

In this case, the \"entity\" operation is defined with a name, type, and input parameters. The lambda function returns a string that includes the value of the \"entityName\" input parameter.\n\nThe third section defines \"Attribute Getters\", which are operations that can be used to query attributes of the entity. In this case, the \"entity-name\" operation is defined as an \"op\" with an input of type \"Entity\" and an output of type \"str\". The function returns the value of the \"name\" attribute of the entity's GraphQL representation.\n\nThe fourth section defines \"Direct Relationship Ops\", which are operations that can be used to query relationships between entities.

The purpose of this file is to define the types that correspond to the types/interfaces in the WB GQL schema. The types are defined using the `weave_type` decorator, which sets the Weave type to be a plain string called \"user\". Each type follows the same pattern for declaration, which includes setting the `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` to specify the minimum GQL fragment that should be used when loading this type from GQL. The data is currently stored in `User.gql`, which gets serialized as an untyped string but can be accessed like a dictionary.\n\nThe `UntypedOpaqueDict` class is a Weave Type that is used to store arbitrary JSON data. Unlike `Dict` or `TypedDict`, this Type does not need to define the keys/fields. This is useful in particular for storing GQL responses where the response schema may change over time. The class provides two methods for creating an instance of the class: `from_json_dict` and `from_dict`. The former creates an instance from a JSON dictionary, while the latter creates an instance from a regular dictionary. The data is serialized as a JSON string, so it can be stored and loaded using the Weave Type system.\n\nThe other classes defined in this file are `Org`, `Entity`, `User`, `Project`, `Run`, `ArtifactType`, `ArtifactCollection`, `ArtifactVersion`, `ArtifactCollectionMembership`, `ArtifactAlias`, `Report`, and `RunQueue`. Each of these classes is a subclass of `GQLTypeMixin`, which provides a `gql` attribute that is an instance of `UntypedOpaqueDict`. The `REQUIRED_FRAGMENT` attribute is set for each class to specify the minimum GQL fragment that should be used when loading the corresponding type from GQL. \n\nOverall, this file provides the necessary types for the Weave project to interact with the WB GQL schema.

This class is used to identify a specific run in the Weave platform. \n\n`WbHistogram` is a decorator type that represents a histogram. It contains two lists: `bins` and `values`. `bins` is a list of floats that represent the bin edges of the histogram, and `values` is a list of integers that represent the number of values in each bin. \n\n`process_run_dict_obj` is a function that takes a dictionary representing a run and processes it. It returns a new dictionary with the same keys as the input dictionary, but with some values replaced. For example, if a value in the input dictionary is a histogram, it will be replaced with an instance of `WbHistogram`. This function is used to process the data returned by the Weave platform when querying for run data. \n\nThe module also defines several helper functions that are used by `process_run_dict_obj`. `filesystem_artifact_file_from_artifact_path` takes an artifact path and returns a `FilesystemArtifactFile` object. `filesystem_runfiles_from_run_path` takes a `RunPath` object and a file path and returns a `path_info` object. `escape_artifact_path` takes an artifact path and returns a modified version of the path that can be used with the `filesystem_artifact_file_from_artifact_path` function. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of tools for processing and manipulating data related to runs in the Weave platform.

This URL is obtained by calling the `direct_url` method of the `artifact` attribute of the input file object, passing in the file's path. This operation is useful for retrieving the file directly from the artifact store without having to go through the `FilesystemArtifactFile` object.\n\nThe second operation, `direct_url_as_of`, is similar to `direct_url` but takes an additional integer parameter `asOf`.

It has a single operation `center` which returns the center point of the bounding box. This class could be used to represent the location and size of an object in an image or the position and size of a UI element.\n\nThe `ImageWithBoxes` class represents an image with a list of bounding boxes. It has a single operation `get_boxes` which returns the list of bounding boxes.

It creates a new file with the name `{name}.html` in the artifact and writes the `html` attribute of the object to the file. `load_instance` takes an artifact and a name as arguments. It opens the file with the name `{name}.html` in the artifact and returns a new `Html` object with the contents of the file as the `html` attribute.\n\nThe `HtmlType` class is decorated with `weave_class` from the `api` module. This decorator registers `HtmlType` as a valid type for use with the `weave` library. This means that `Html` objects can be used as inputs and outputs for `weave` functions.\n\nThe last line of the code sets the `instance_classes` attribute of `HtmlType` to `Html`. This is necessary for `weave` to know which class to use when loading an instance of `HtmlType`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to serialize and deserialize `Html` objects using the `weave` library. It allows `Html` objects to be used as inputs and outputs for `weave` functions, which can be useful in larger projects that involve processing and analyzing HTML data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```python\nfrom weave import Artifact\n\n# create an Html object\nmy_html = Html(\"<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>\")\n\n# create an artifact\nmy_artifact = Artifact(\"my_artifact\")\n\n# save the Html object to the artifact\nHtmlType().save_instance(my_html, my_artifact, \"my_html\")\n\n# load the Html object from the artifact\nloaded_html = HtmlType().load_instance(my_artifact, \"my_html\")\n\n# check that the loaded object is the same as the original\nassert my_html.html == loaded_html.html\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It also includes methods for creating instances of the type from PIL images (`type_of_instance`), saving PIL images to an artifact (`save_instance`), and loading PIL images from an artifact (`load_instance`). \n\nThe `PILImageOps` class is a `weave` class that uses `PILImageType` as its `weave_type`. This class includes two operations: `image_bytes` and `width_`. \n\nThe `image_bytes` operation takes a PIL image and returns a string of its binary data in hexadecimal format. This operation first saves the image to an in-memory file using the `save` method of the PIL image object. It then reads the binary data from the file, encodes it as a hexadecimal string, and returns the result. \n\nThe `width_` operation takes a PIL image and returns its width as an integer. This operation simply returns the `width` attribute of the PIL image object. \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to define and manipulate PIL images as a `weave` type.

It has attributes for width, height, and mode, and methods for saving and loading instances of the class.\n\n3. Why does the `PILImageOps` class have a TODO comment?\n- Answer: The `PILImageOps` class has a TODO comment because it currently hardcodes the type constants for the `image_bytes` and `width_` methods, which is not ideal.

The first function, `load_jsonl`, takes a file object in JSON Lines format and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the file. The function reads each row in the file, converts it from a string to a dictionary using the `json.loads` method, and appends the resulting dictionary to a list. This function can be used to load data from a JSON Lines file into a Python program.\n\nThe second function, `refine_readjsonl`, is a decorator that defines an operation called `file-refine_readjsonl`. This operation takes a file object in JSON Lines format and returns a `weave.types.Type` object that represents the data in the file. The operation uses the `load_jsonl` function to load the data from the file and then uses `weave.types.TypeRegistry.type_of` to convert the data into a `weave.types.Type` object. This operation is marked as hidden, which means it is not intended to be used directly by users of the `weave` project.\n\nThe third function, `readjsonl`, is a decorator that defines an operation called `file-readjsonl`. This operation takes a file object in JSON Lines format and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row in the file. The operation uses the `load_jsonl` function to load the data from the file and returns the resulting list. This operation also specifies the input and output types for the operation, as well as a refinement function (`refine_readjsonl`) that is used to convert the output of the operation into a `weave.types.Type` object. This operation can be used to read data from a JSON Lines file and return it as a list of dictionaries.\n\nThe final function, `json_dumps`, is a simple utility function that takes any Python object and returns a JSON-encoded string representation of the object. This function can be used to convert Python objects into JSON format for storage or transmission.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a way to load and read data from JSON Lines files in the `weave` project, and to convert Python objects to and from JSON format. The `load_jsonl` function is used internally by the `file-readjsonl` and `file-refine_readjsonl` operations, which can be used to read and process JSON Lines files in a `weave` workflow. The `json_dumps` function can be used to encode Python objects as JSON strings for storage or transmission.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The primary class, `List`, provides methods for common list operations such as `count`, `filter`, `sort`, `map`, `groupby`, `offset`, `limit`, `dropna`, and `concat`. These methods are decorated with the `@op` decorator, which allows them to be used as operations in the Weave language.\n\nFor example, the `filter` method takes a list and a filter function as input and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the filter function returns `True`:\n\n```python\n@op(\n    name=\"filter\",\n    input_type={\n        \"arr\": types.List(types.Any()),\n        \"filterFn\": lambda input_types: types.Function(\n            {\"row\": input_types[\"arr\"].object_type}, types.optional(types.Boolean())\n        ),\n    },\n    output_type=lambda input_types: input_types[\"arr\"],\n)\ndef filter(arr, filterFn):\n    call_results = execute_fast.fast_map_fn(arr, filterFn)\n    result = []\n    for row, keep in zip(arr, call_results):\n        if keep:\n            result.append(row)\n    return result\n```\n\nIn addition to the `List` class, the code also defines several standalone functions for working with lists, such as `map_each`, `join`, `join_all`, `flatten`, `unnest`, `unique`, `make_list`, and `cross_product`. These functions are also decorated with the `@op` decorator and can be used as operations in the Weave language.\n\nFor instance, the `join` function takes two lists, two key functions, and optional alias and outer join flags, and returns a new list containing the joined elements:\n\n```python\n@op(\n    name=\"join\",\n    input_type={\n        \"arr1\": types.List(),\n        \"arr2\": types.List(),\n        \"joinFn1\": lambda input_types: types.Function(\n            {\"row\": input_types[\"arr1\"].object_type}, types.Any()\n        ),\n        \"joinFn2\": lambda input_types: types.Function(\n            {\"row\": input_types[\"arr2\"].object_type}, types.Any()\n        ),\n        \"alias1\": types.String(),\n        \"alias2\": types.String(),\n        \"leftOuter\": types.Boolean(),\n        \"rightOuter\": types.Boolean(),\n    },\n    output_type=_join_2_output_type,\n)\ndef join_2(arr1, arr2, joinFn1, joinFn2, alias1, alias2, leftOuter, rightOuter):\n    # Implementation details...\n```\n\nThese list operations can be used in the larger Weave project to manipulate and transform lists of data as part of a data analysis pipeline.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `general_picker` function and where is it used?\n   **Answer**: The `general_picker` function is used to extract the values of a given key from a list of dictionaries (obj). However, it is not used anywhere in the provided code.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `join_2` function work and what are the input parameters?\n   **Answer**: The `join_2` function performs a join operation on two lists of dictionaries (arr1 and arr2) based on the keys generated by applying joinFn1 and joinFn2 functions on each row of arr1 and arr2, respectively. The input parameters are arr1, arr2, joinFn1, joinFn2, alias1, alias2, leftOuter, and rightOuter. The aliases are used to name the resulting joined columns, and the leftOuter and rightOuter flags determine if the join should be a left or right outer join.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `flatten` function and how does it handle nested lists?\n   **Answer**: The `flatten` function is used to flatten a nested list structure into a single-level list. It recursively processes the input list and its nested lists, combining their elements into a single list. If the input list contains ArrowWeaveList objects, it uses the `pushdown_list_tags` function to handle them.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_primitives/list_.md"}}],["350",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_primitives/list_range.py)\n\nThe code above defines a function called `range` that takes in three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. The purpose of this function is to create a list of integers that starts at `start`, ends at `stop`, and increments by `step`. \n\nThe function makes use of the built-in `range` function in Python, which generates a sequence of numbers. However, since the `range` function in Python 3 returns a range object instead of a list, the code uses the `py_range` variable to store the original `range` function from Python 2, which returns a list. \n\nThe `@op` decorator above the function indicates that this function is an operation that can be used in the larger project. The `name` parameter specifies the name of the operation, which in this case is \"range\". \n\nTo use this function in the larger project, one would simply import it from the `weave` module and call it with the desired arguments. For example:\n\n```\nfrom weave import range\n\nmy_list = range(0, 10, 2)\nprint(my_list) # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to generate a list of integers with a specified start, stop, and step value, and can be used as an operation in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes in three integer arguments and returns a list of integers generated by the `range` function.\n\n2. Why is the `py_range` variable defined and used instead of just using the built-in `range` function?\n- The `py_range` variable is defined to avoid potential naming conflicts with other modules that may have defined their own `range` function. It is used in this code to ensure that the built-in `range` function is used without any interference.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `@op` decorator and how does it affect the behavior of the `range` function?\n- The `@op` decorator is used to register the `range` function as an operation in the `weave` API.

The `tagging` module is being imported to access the `make_tag_getter_op` function.\n\n2. What do the `make_tag_getter_op` function calls do?\n- The `make_tag_getter_op` function is being called three times to create three different tag getter operations. These operations retrieve specific tags from a given object.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `op_name` parameter in the `make_tag_getter_op` function calls?\n- The `op_name` parameter is used to specify a name for the tag getter operation being created. This name can be used to identify the operation later on.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_primitives/list_tag_getters.md"}}],["352",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_primitives/markdown.py)\n\nThis code defines a class called `Markdown` and a subclass called `MarkdownType`. The `Markdown` class has a single attribute called `md`, which is a string representing markdown text. The `MarkdownType` class is a subclass of `Type` from the `weave_types` module. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide functionality for saving and loading instances of the `Markdown` class to and from artifacts. An artifact is a file or directory that contains data related to a project. The `MarkdownType` class defines two methods, `save_instance` and `load_instance`, which are used to save and load instances of the `Markdown` class to and from artifacts, respectively. \n\nThe `save_instance` method takes three arguments: `obj`, `artifact`, and `name`. `obj` is an instance of the `Markdown` class, `artifact` is an instance of the `Artifact` class (not shown in this code), and `name` is a string representing the name of the artifact file. The method opens a new file in the artifact with the name `{name}.md` and writes the `md` attribute of the `obj` instance to the file.\n\nThe `load_instance` method takes two arguments: `artifact` and `name`. `artifact` is an instance of the `Artifact` class, and `name` is a string representing the name of the artifact file. The method opens the file `{name}.md` in the artifact and reads the contents of the file into a new instance of the `Markdown` class, which is then returned.\n\nThe `MarkdownType` class is decorated with the `weave_class` decorator from the `api` module, which registers the class with the `weave` module. This allows instances of the `Markdown` class to be saved and loaded using the `weave` module's artifact system.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to save and load instances of the `Markdown` class to and from artifacts using the `weave` module.

Finally, it prints the markdown text, which should be \"# Hello, world!\".\n## Questions: \n 1.

This means that instances of `Markdown` will be saved and loaded using the methods defined in `MarkdownType`.\n\n3. What is the role of the `weave` module in this code?\n   \n   The `weave` module is used to decorate the `Markdown` class with the `weave_class` decorator. This allows `Markdown` instances to be saved and loaded using the `weave` library's artifact system.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_primitives/markdown.md"}}],["353",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_primitives/number.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains a collection of operations and classes related to numerical computations. The `Number` class is a custom implementation of a number type that supports various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. Each operation is implemented as a method of the `Number` class and is decorated with the `op` decorator, which specifies the name of the operation, the input and output types, and any additional metadata.\n\nFor example, the `__add__` method is decorated with `op(name=\"number-add\", input_type=binary_number_op_input_type, output_type=types.Number())`, which means that it is the implementation of the \"number-add\" operation, takes two arguments of type `Number`, and returns a `Number`. The `__add__` method checks if either of the operands is `None` and returns `None` if so. Otherwise, it performs the addition and returns the result.\n\nThe `weave` module also provides a set of operations for working with lists of numbers, such as `numbers_sum`, `numbers_avg`, `numbers_min`, `numbers_max`, `numbers_argmax`, `numbers_argmin`, and `stddev`. These operations take a list of numbers as input and return a single number or `None` depending on the operation. For example, `numbers_sum` returns the sum of the numbers in the list, while `numbers_avg` returns the average.\n\nFinally, the `weave` module provides two operations for generating random numbers drawn from a univariate Gaussian distribution: `random_normal_single` and `random_normal`. The former generates a single random number, while the latter generates a list of random numbers. Both operations take the mean and standard deviation of the distribution as input.\n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides a set of operations and classes for performing numerical computations and working with lists of numbers. These operations can be used in larger projects that require numerical computations, such as data analysis or machine learning.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `numbers_ops_output_type` function?\n- The `numbers_ops_output_type` function is used to determine the output type of operations that take a list of numbers as input. It returns the type of the numbers in the list if they are all of the same type, or `NoneType` if the list contains any `None` values.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `random_normal` function?\n- The `random_normal` function generates a list of random numbers drawn from a univariate Gaussian distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_primitives/number.md"}}],["354",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_primitives/number_bin.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains code for working with numerical data and creating bins for that data. The module imports the `math` library and several other modules from the `weave` project. \n\nThe `number_bins_fixed` function takes a single input parameter `step`, which is a number. The function returns a function that takes a single input parameter `row`, which is also a number. The returned function calculates the start and stop values for a bin based on the `step` parameter and the input `row` value. If the `step` parameter is less than or equal to zero, a `ValueError` is raised. The `make_const_node` function is used to create a constant node with a value of `1.0 / step`, which is then used to calculate the `start_node` value. The `start_node` value is calculated by multiplying the `row` value by the `mult` value, rounding down to the nearest integer, and then dividing by the `mult` value. The `stop` value is calculated by adding the `step` value to the `start_node` value. The `define_fn` function is used to define the function body and return the function.\n\nThe `numbers_bins_equal` function takes two input parameters: a list of numbers `arr` and a number of bins `bins`. The function returns a function that takes a single input parameter `row`, which is a number. The function calculates the minimum and maximum values of the `arr` list and then calculates the `step` value by dividing the difference between the maximum and minimum values by the number of bins. The `number_bins_fixed` function is then called with the `step` value to create a function that can be used to calculate the start and stop values for each bin. The `use` function is used to call the `number_bins_fixed` function and return the resulting function.\n\nThe `number_bin` function takes two input parameters: a number `in_` and a function `bin_fn`. The function returns the result of calling the `bin_fn` function with a dictionary containing a single key-value pair, where the key is `\"row\"` and the value is a constant node with a value of `in_`. The `call_fn` function is used to call the `bin_fn` function with the dictionary argument.\n\nOverall, the `weave` module provides functions for creating bins for numerical data. The `number_bins_fixed` function creates a function that calculates the start and stop values for a bin based on a fixed step size. The `numbers_bins_equal` function creates a function that calculates the start and stop values for a bin based on a specified number of bins. The `number_bin` function applies a binning function to a single input value. These functions can be used in conjunction with other functions in the `weave` project to analyze and visualize numerical data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport weave\n\n# create a function for fixed-size bins with a step of 0.5\nbin_fn = weave.number_bins_fixed(0.5)\n\n# calculate the bin for the value 3.2\nbin = weave.number_bin(3.2, bin_fn)\n\n# create a function for equal-size bins with 10 bins\nbin_fn = weave.numbers_bins_equal([1.2, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8, 9.0], 10)\n\n# calculate the bin for the value 6.7\nbin = weave.number_bin(6.7, bin_fn)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function first checks if the `self` argument of the input type is a constant value, and if so, sets it to the type of that value. If `self` is an object type, the function checks if the `name` argument of the input type is a constant value, and if so, returns the type of the property with that name on the object. If `self` is of type `Any`, the function returns `Any`. If `self` is of type `Type`, the function returns a type based on the `name` argument, either a dictionary of string keys to type values for `\"property_types\"`, a list of type values for `\"members\"`, or a `TypeType` for any other name.

This operation is decorated with the `op` decorator, which registers it as an operation in the `weave` API. The `input_type` argument of the decorator specifies that the `self` argument of the function should be of type `ObjectType`, and the `output_type` argument specifies that the output type should be determined by the `getattr_output_type` function.\n\nThe `generate_code_for_object` function takes an object and returns a string representation of the code needed to create that object. This function is decorated with the `op` decorator, but is marked as hidden, meaning it is not intended to be used directly by users of the `weave` API. \n\nOverall, this file provides functionality related to object attribute access and code generation, which may be used in other parts of the `weave` project. For example, the `obj_getattr` operation could be used to access attributes of objects in a larger program, and the `generate_code_for_object` operation could be used to generate code for objects that need to be serialized or deserialized.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This module is imported in the code and it defines types used in the `union_output_type` and `difference_output_type` functions.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `op` decorator and how is it used in this code?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `op` decorator does and how it is used in this code. The `op` decorator is used to define an operation function and specify its output type. It is used to decorate the `union` and `difference` functions in this code.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of the `union` and `difference` functions?\n- A smart developer might ask what the expected input and output of the `union` and `difference` functions are. The input is expected to be two lists of strings (`s1` and `s2`) and the output is a list of strings that is either the union or difference of the two input lists, depending on which function is called. The output type is determined by the `output_type` argument passed to the `op` decorator.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/ops_primitives/set_.md"}}],["361",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/ops_primitives/sql.py)\n\nThe `weave` module contains code for working with SQL databases. The `SqlTable` class represents a table in a SQL database and provides methods for querying and manipulating the data in the table. \n\nThe `SqlTable` class has several methods for querying the data in the table. The `count` method returns the number of rows in the table. The `__getitem__` method allows indexing into the table to retrieve a specific row. The `pick` method allows selecting a specific column from the table. The `map` method applies a function to each row in the table and returns a list of the results. The `filter` method applies a filter function to the rows in the table and returns a new `SqlTable` object with the filtered rows. The `groupby` method groups the rows in the table by a specified key and returns a list of groups, where each group is a list of rows.\n\nThe `SqlConnection` class represents a connection to a SQL database. It has a `table` method that returns a `SqlTable` object for a specified table in the database. The `sqlconnection_tables` method returns a dictionary of `SqlTable` objects for all tables in the database.\n\nThe code also includes several utility functions for working with SQL databases, such as `local_sqlconnection` for creating a local connection to a database and `sqlconnection_tables_type` for returning the types of all tables in a database.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient and flexible way to work with SQL databases in a Python project.

It returns the name of the type as a string. This function is decorated with the `op` decorator, which is used to register the function as an operation that can be executed by the `weave` system. The `name` argument of the `op` decorator specifies the name of the operation.\n\nThe `cast` function takes two arguments: `obj` and `to_type`. `obj` can be any Python object, and `to_type` is an instance of the `Type` class defined in the `weave_types` module. The purpose of this function is to cast `obj` to the specified type. This function is also decorated with the `op` decorator, and the `input_type` and `output_type` arguments of the decorator specify the expected input and output types of the operation.\n\nThe `_cast_output_type` function is a helper function used by the `cast` function to extract the output type from the `to_type` argument. This function is not intended to be used directly.\n\nOverall, these functions provide basic type manipulation functionality for the `weave` system. The `type_name` function can be used to retrieve the name of a type, and the `cast` function can be used to cast objects to a specified type.

However, this code is importing from `weave.api`, `weave.errors`, and `weave.weave_types`, suggesting that `weave` is a larger project with multiple modules and functionality.\n2. What is the `op` decorator used for and how does it work?\n- The `op` decorator is used to define an operation in `weave`. It takes in arguments such as `name`, `input_type`, and `output_type` to specify the operation's behavior and input/output types. The decorated function is then registered as an operation in the `weave` system.\n3.

The `created_by` function returns the creator of an object, while the `save` function saves an object and returns a reference to it. The `used_by` function returns a list of runs that use a given object.\n\nThe `objects` function returns a list of objects of a specified type, while the `local_artifacts` function returns a list of local artifacts. The `execute` function is used to execute a given node, and the `set`, `append`, `merge`, `delete_artifact`, `undo_artifact`, `rename_artifact`, and `publish_artifact` functions are used to perform various mutations on objects and artifacts.\n\nThe `Run` class provides methods for setting the state, inputs, and output of a run, as well as logging and printing information related to the run.

These functions are used to convert values passed to panels into JSON format and to retrieve child items respectively.\n\nThe `make_node` function takes a single argument `v`, which can be of any type. The function first checks if `v` is already an instance of the `graph.Node` class. If it is, the function simply returns `v`. If not, the function determines the type of `v` using the `weave_types.TypeRegistry` class. If the type of `v` is JSON-compatible, the function creates a new `graph.ConstNode` object with the type and value of `v`. If the type of `v` is not JSON-compatible, the function saves `v` to storage using the `storage.save` function and retrieves a reference to it using the `ops.get` function. The function then returns the reference to the `graph.Node` object.\n\nThe `child_item` function takes a single argument `v`, which can be of any type. If `v` is already an instance of the `panel.Panel` class, the function simply returns `v`.

By registering the class as a type in the `weave` module, other parts of the project can use the `weave` module to create instances of `Histogram` panels without having to import the `Histogram` class directly.\n\nFor example, if another part of the project wanted to create a `Histogram` panel, it could do so like this:\n\n```\nimport weave\n\nhistogram_panel = weave.create_panel(\"histogram\")\n```\n\nThis would create a new instance of the `Histogram` class and return it as a `Panel` object. The `Panel` object could then be added to a dashboard or used in some other way.\n\nThe `id` attribute of the `Histogram` class is set to \"histogram\". This is used by the `weave` module to identify the class as a type of panel. The comment above the `id` attribute indicates that there may be a conflict with another type of panel that also uses the name \"histogram\". \n\nOverall, this code provides a way to create and use a new type of panel in the `weave` module.

This attribute is used to identify the panel in the larger project.\n\nThe `__init__` method of the `PanelHtml` class takes in several parameters. The `input_node` parameter is used to specify the input node for the panel. This node is converted to a proper format using the `panel_util.make_node` function.

The code in this file defines two classes: `LabeledItemConfig` and `LabeledItem`. \n\n`LabeledItemConfig` is a generic class that defines a labeled item. It has two attributes: `label` and `item`. `label` is a string that represents the label of the item, while `item` is a generic type that represents the item itself. The default value of `label` is an empty string, and the default value of `item` is a `VoidNode` object from the `graph` module. \n\n`LabeledItem` is a subclass of `Panel` from the `panel` module. It has an `id` attribute set to \"LabeledItem\", and a `config` attribute that is an instance of `LabeledItemConfig`. The `__init__` method of `LabeledItem` takes an `input_node`, `vars`, `config`, and `options` as arguments. It initializes the `Panel` superclass with `input_node` and `vars`, and then sets the `config` attribute to the value of `config` if it is not `None`, otherwise it creates a new `LabeledItemConfig` object with the `label` and `item` values from `options`. \n\nThis code can be used to create labeled items in a web-based visualization. For example, if we want to create a labeled item with the label \"Temperature\" and the value 25, we can do the following:\n\n```\nfrom weave import LabeledItem, LabeledItemConfig\n\nconfig = LabeledItemConfig(label=\"Temperature\", item=25)\nlabeled_item = LabeledItem(config=config)\n```\n\nThis will create a new `LabeledItem` object with the label \"Temperature\" and the value 25. We can then add this object to our visualization using the `add` method of a `Layout` object.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `LabeledItem` class and how is it used?\n- The `LabeledItem` class is a subclass of `panel.Panel` and is used to create a labeled item with a specified label and item. It can be instantiated with an input node, variables, and options.\n\n2. What is the `LabeledItemConfig` class and how does it relate to `LabeledItem`?\n- The `LabeledItemConfig` class is a generic class that defines the configuration options for a `LabeledItem`. It includes a label and an item of a specified type. `LabeledItem` has an optional `config` attribute that can be set to an instance of `LabeledItemConfig`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `weave.type()` decorator used on `LabeledItemConfig` and `LabeledItem`?\n- The `weave.type()` decorator is used to indicate that the classes are \"weavable\", meaning that they can be used with the `weave` library to create a dataflow graph.

Panels are UI components that display data in various ways. The list of panels is defined as a list of LPanel objects, which are dataclasses that contain a panel_id and an optional typename_override. The panel_id is a string that identifies the panel, and the typename_override is an optional string that can be used to override the default name of the panel.\n\nThe define_panel function is used to define each panel as a subclass of the Panel class in the weave.panel module. The function takes an LPanel object as an argument, creates a new subclass of Panel with the panel_id set to the panel_id of the LPanel object, and returns the new subclass. If the typename_override is not None, the function also defines a new panel with the same panel_id prefixed with \"maybe.\" and the typename_override as the typename.\n\nThe code then iterates over the list of panels and calls the define_panel function for each panel. If a typename_override is specified for a panel, the function is also called for the \"maybe.\" version of the panel. The defined panels can then be used in the larger project to display data in various ways.\n\nFor example, to use the barchart panel to display data, the following code could be used:\n\n```\nfrom weave import panel\n\nclass MyBarchartPanel(panel.PanelBarchart):\n    # custom implementation here\n\nmy_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nMyBarchartPanel(data=my_data).show()\n```\n\nThis would create a new subclass of PanelBarchart called MyBarchartPanel, instantiate it with the my_data list as the data argument, and display it using the show method.\n## Questions: \n 1.

How are panels defined in this code, and what is the purpose of the `define_panel` function?\n   \n   Panels are defined by creating a dummy class that inherits from `weave.panel.Panel` and setting its `id` attribute to the `panel_id` of the corresponding `LPanel` instance. The `define_panel` function is used to create these dummy classes and register them with `weave.types`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `did_define` variable and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `did_define` variable is used to ensure that the `define_panel` function is only called once. It is set to `False` initially, and then set to `True` after all the panels have been defined.

The `PlotConfig` class contains information about the plot's series, axis settings, legend settings, and other configurations. The `Series` class represents a single series in the plot and contains information about the table state, dimensions, constants, and UI state.\n\nThe code also defines several utility functions, such as `set_through_array`, `get_through_array`, and `ensure_node`, which are used to manipulate nested object structures. These functions are used in the `Plot` class to set and get values for various attributes and configurations.\n\nThe `Plot` class has several methods for setting and getting values for dimensions and constants across all series in the plot.

The module includes a list of functions that generate different types of metrics, such as metrics that simulate decreasing loss or increasing accuracy. These functions are stored in a list called `value_fns`. \n\nThe `random_metrics_template` function takes an integer argument `n_metrics` and returns a list of `n_metrics` random integers between 0 and the length of `value_fns`. This list is used to select which functions from `value_fns` to use when generating metrics.\n\nThe `random_metrics` function generates a set of metrics based on the specified parameters. It takes three arguments: `n` (the number of steps), `n_metrics` (the number of metrics to generate), and `template` (an optional list of integers that specifies which functions from `value_fns` to use). \n\nThe function first generates an array of steps using `np.arange`. It then creates a dictionary called `data` that includes the step array and a randomly generated string column. For each metric, the function selects a function from `value_fns` based on the `template` argument (if provided) or randomly otherwise. It then generates an array of values using the selected function and adds noise to the array based on a randomly selected noise type (uniform, normal, or triangular). The function also applies a filter to the noise to simulate more natural variations. The resulting array of values is added to the `data` dictionary with a key of the form `metric{j}`.\n\nThe function returns an `ArrowWeaveList` object that contains a PyArrow table with the generated metrics.\n\nThe `random_runs` function generates a set of runs based on the specified parameters. It takes three arguments: `n_runs` (the number of runs to generate), `n_steps` (the number of steps per run), and `n_metrics` (the number of metrics per step). \n\nThe function generates a list of runs by calling `random_metrics` for each run and concatenating the resulting tables using PyArrow's `concat_arrays` function. It then creates a PyArrow struct array for each run that includes a randomly generated ID, a randomly generated configuration, and the metrics generated by `random_metrics`.

The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to handle errors in a consistent and type-safe manner. \n\nThe `_ValueOrErrorInterface` class defines an interface for values that may contain errors. It has three methods: `unwrap`, `transform_and_catch`, and `apply_and_catch`. The `unwrap` method returns the value if there is no error, and raises an exception if there is an error. The `transform_and_catch` method applies a function to the value, catching any exceptions that may be raised and returning a new `_ValueOrErrorInterface` object that contains either the transformed value or the error. The `apply_and_catch` method applies a function to the value, catching any exceptions that may be raised and returning either the original `_ValueOrErrorInterface` object or a new one that contains the error.\n\nThe `Value` and `Error` classes implement the `_ValueOrErrorInterface` interface. The `Value` class represents a value that does not contain an error, and the `Error` class represents an error. Both classes have an `_value` or `_error` attribute, respectively, that stores the value or error.\n\nThe `ValueOrError` type is a union of `Value` and `Error`, representing a value that may or may not contain an error.\n\nThe `ValueOrErrors` class is a generic class that represents a collection of `ValueOrError` objects. It has several methods for manipulating the collection, such as `safe_map`, `raw_map`, `safe_apply`, `batch_map`, and `zip`. These methods apply functions to the values in the collection, catching any exceptions that may be raised and returning a new `ValueOrErrors` object that contains either the transformed values or the errors. The `zip` method combines two `ValueOrErrors` objects into a new one that contains tuples of values from the two objects.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to handle values that may or may not contain errors in a consistent and type-safe manner. It can be used in the larger project to handle errors in a variety of contexts, such as data validation, input/output operations, and more. Here is an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```\nvalues = [1, 2, 3, \"four\", 5]\nvalue_or_errors = ValueOrErrors.from_values(values)\n\n# Transform values and catch errors\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\nsquared_values = value_or_errors.safe_map(square)\nprint(squared_values.unwrap())  # [1, 4, 9, Error(ValueError(\"invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'four'\")), 25]\n\n# Apply function and catch errors\ndef print_value(x):\n    print(x)\n\nvalue_or_errors.safe_apply(print_value)  # prints 1, 2, 3, four, 5\n\n# Batch map and catch errors\ndef divide_by_two(values):\n    return ValueOrErrors([Value(v / 2) if v % 2 == 0 else Error(ValueError(\"value is not even\")) for v in values])\n\ndivided_values = value_or_errors.batch_map(divide_by_two)\nprint(divided_values.iter_items())  # [(0.5, None), (1, Error(ValueError(\"value is not even\"))), (1.5, None), (Error(ValueError(\"invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'four'\")), None), (2.5, None)]\n\n# Zip two collections\nvalues2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nvalue_or_errors2 = ValueOrErrors.from_values(values2)\n\nzipped_values = value_or_errors.zip(value_or_errors2)\nprint(zipped_values.unwrap())  # [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (Error(ValueError(\"invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'four'\")), 40), (5, 50)]\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `_ValueOrErrorInterface` class?\n- The `_ValueOrErrorInterface` class is a generic interface that defines methods for unwrapping a value or error, transforming a value and catching errors, and applying a function to a value and catching errors.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `ValueOrErrors` class?\n- The `ValueOrErrors` class is a generic class that represents a list of values or errors. It provides methods for safely mapping a function over the values, applying a function to the values and catching errors, and zipping two `ValueOrErrors` instances together.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `batch_map` method in the `ValueOrErrors` class?\n- The `batch_map` method in the `ValueOrErrors` class takes a function that maps a list of values to a `ValueOrErrors` instance, and applies it to the list of values in the `ValueOrErrors` instance. It returns a new `ValueOrErrors` instance that contains the results of the mapping, with errors propagated through from the original `ValueOrErrors` instance.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/value_or_error.md"}}],["422",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/wandb_api.py)\n\nThis file provides an official interface for interacting with the W&B API, and all interactions with the Weave API should go through this module.

These classes can be used as the core of a fast artifact downloader or a safe multiplexed file manager in the Weave server.\n\nBoth classes have similar methods, with the `WandbFileManagerAsync` class using asynchronous methods for better performance. The main methods in these classes are:\n\n- `manifest()`: Retrieves the manifest of an artifact, which contains metadata about the artifact and its files. The manifest is first checked in the cache, and if not found, it is downloaded from the W&B platform.\n- `local_path_and_download_url()`: Returns the local path and download URL for a file within an artifact.

These features can be enabled by setting the `WEAVE_SERVER_DEBUG` environment variable.\n\nHere's an example of using the `/__weave/execute` endpoint:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndata = {\n    \"graphs\": [\n        {\n            \"nodes\": [\n                {\"op\": \"weave.add\", \"args\": [1, 2]},\n            ],\n            \"edges\": [],\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(\"http://localhost:9994/__weave/execute\", json=data)\nprint(response.json())\n```\n\nThis would execute the `weave.add` operation with arguments `1` and `2`, and return the result `{\"data\": [3], \"errors\": [], \"node_to_error\": {}}`.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PROFILE_DIR` variable and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `PROFILE_DIR` variable is used to store the directory path for profiling data. If it is not `None`, the code will create the directory if it doesn't exist and store profiling data for the `/__weave/execute` endpoint in that directory. This can be useful for performance analysis and optimization.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `execute()` function handle errors and what information is logged?\n   **Answer**: The `execute()` function uses the `_value_or_errors_to_response()` function to process the response and extract error information. It then logs the errors using the `_log_errors()` function, which logs the error message, error type, traceback, and associated node strings for each error.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `import_ecosystem()` function and how is it used in the code?\n   **Answer**: The `import_ecosystem()` function attempts to import the MVP ecosystem modules (such as `langchain` and `replicate`) and the entire Weave ecosystem if the `WEAVE_SERVER_DISABLE_ECOSYSTEM` environment variable is not set. This function is called in the `make_app()` function to ensure that the ecosystem modules are imported and registered when the Flask app is created.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave/weave_server.md"}}],["430",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave/weavejs_fixes.py)\n\nThe `weave_js_compat.py` file contains functions that provide compatibility fixes for WeaveJS.

The purpose of these functions is to enable the creation of a graph-based representation of a computation that can be optimized and executed efficiently.\n\nThe `op_to_weave_fn` function takes an op_def object and returns a weave_fn object. The function first checks if the op_def is a mapped op or an Arrow op, which cannot be converted to a weave_fn. It then checks if the op_def is a base op or a variadic op, which are also not convertible. If the op_def passes these checks, the function creates a weave_fn by defining a function body that takes in arguments corresponding to the op_def's input types and returns a graph node representing the result of the op_def's resolve function. The function body is defined using the `define_fn` function from the `weave_internal` module. The resulting weave_fn is then validated using the `verify_weave_fn_is_valid` function, which checks that the weave_fn does not contain a call to itself.\n\nThe `weavify_object` function takes a Python object and returns a graph node representing the object. The function first checks if the object is already a graph node or a constant value, in which case it returns the object. If the object is a list or a dictionary, the function recursively applies itself to each element of the list or dictionary and returns a graph node representing the resulting list or dictionary. If the object is a custom Python object, the function uses the object's constructor to create a dictionary of its attributes and recursively applies itself to each attribute. The resulting dictionary is then used to create a graph node representing the object.\n\nThese functions are used in the larger project to enable the creation of a graph-based representation of a computation that can be optimized and executed efficiently. The op_to_weave_fn function is used to convert operation definitions to weave functions, which can then be combined into a graph representing the computation. The weavify_object function is used to convert Python objects to graph nodes, which can then be used as inputs to the weave functions.\n## Questions: \n 1.

Each of these properties is an object with three properties, `meta`, `create`, and `fixable`. \n\nThe `isGlobalThisReferenceOrGlobalWindow` function takes two arguments, `scope` and `node`. It returns a boolean indicating whether the `node` argument is a reference to the global `this` object or the global `window` object. The function checks whether the `node` argument is a `ThisExpression` and whether the `scope` argument is of type `global`. If the `node` argument is a `MemberExpression`, the function checks whether the `object` property of the `node` argument is an `Identifier` with a name of `window` or `document`. If the `node` argument is an `Identifier`, the function checks whether its name is `globalThis` and whether the `scope` argument has a variable with the name `globalThis`.\n\nThe `skipChainExpression` function takes a single argument, `node`. It returns the `expression` property of the `node` argument if the `type` property of the `node` argument is `'ChainExpression'`. Otherwise, it returns the `node` argument.\n\nThe `getProjectRoot` function takes a single argument, `filename`. It returns the root directory of the project that contains the file specified by the `filename` argument. The function first gets the parent directory of the file specified by the `filename` argument.

The `menu` module may contain code related to the application's menu, such as creating and managing menu items. Finally, the `types` module may contain custom type definitions used throughout the project.\n\nBy exporting all the modules from these files, other parts of the `weave` project can easily import and use the functionality provided by these modules. For example, if another file in the project needs to use a custom type defined in the `types` module, it can simply import it using `import { CustomType } from 'weave/types'`.\n\nThis code follows the best practice of modularization, where code is split into smaller, more manageable modules that can be easily imported and used in other parts of the project. This makes the code more organized, easier to maintain, and more scalable.\n\nOverall, this code is a crucial part of the `weave` project as it allows for the easy sharing and use of functionality across different parts of the application.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `weave` project?**\\\n   The code provided only exports modules from other files.

The code in this file is responsible for rendering a context menu that appears when a user right-clicks on a data node in the visualization. The context menu provides a list of actions that can be performed on the node, such as filtering, grouping, and sorting.\n\nThe `ActionsTrigger` component is the entry point for the context menu. It takes an input node and an optional list of extra actions as props. When the user right-clicks on the node, the `toggleActions` function is called, which sets the position of the context menu to the cursor position and toggles the visibility of the `ActionsContent` component.\n\nThe `ActionsContent` component is responsible for rendering the context menu. It takes an anchor element, a list of actions, an input node, a stack, and a close function as props. The `anchor` prop is used to position the context menu relative to the cursor position. The `actions` prop is a list of `NodeAction` objects that define the actions that can be performed on the node. The `input` prop is the data node that was right-clicked on. The `stack` prop is a stack of data nodes that represent the current state of the visualization. The `close` function is called when the user clicks outside the context menu to close it.\n\nThe `ActionsContent` component uses the `useWeaveContext` hook to get access to the `weave` object, which provides a set of utility functions for working with data nodes. It uses the `useEffect` hook to asynchronously resolve the labels and descriptions for each action in the `actions` prop. It then renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Menu` component that contains a list of `Menu.Item` components, each of which represents an action that can be performed on the node. The `Menu.Item` components are rendered using the `map` function to iterate over the `items` state variable, which is an array of objects that contain the label, description, and action for each item.\n\nThe `ActionsContent` component also renders an expression and a type for the input node. The expression is a string representation of the node's value, and the type is a string representation of the node's data type. The `detailed` state variable is used to toggle between a detailed and a summary view of the expression and type. The `MiniExpression` component is a styled component that renders the expression and type strings.\n\nThe `ActionsContent` component uses the `ReactDOM.createPortal` function to render the context menu outside of the component's parent DOM hierarchy. This is necessary because the context menu needs to be positioned relative to the cursor position, which is not possible if the menu is rendered inside the parent hierarchy.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible context menu that can be used to perform a wide range of actions on data nodes in the `weave` visualization. The `ActionsTrigger` component can be used in conjunction with other `weave` components to build complex interactive visualizations that allow users to explore and analyze data in real time.\n## Questions: \n 1.

Each icon is assigned a unique Unicode code point that is displayed in a span element with the class \"i-code\". The name of the icon is displayed in a span element with the class \"i-name\".\n\nThe web page is divided into three main sections: the header, the icons, and the footer. The header contains the title of the page and a switch that toggles the display of the icon codes. The icons section contains several rows of icons, each row containing four icons. The footer contains a link to the website that generated the font.\n\nThe code uses the Bootstrap framework to define the layout and styling of the page. The Bootstrap classes are used to define the container, row, and span elements that are used to create a responsive grid layout.

It takes in an array of options, a value, and a callback function to be called when an option is selected. It also provides optional callbacks for when the input field is focused or blurred. \n\nThe component renders an input field with a styled component called `BlankInput`. The `BlankInput` component is a styled `input` element with a border, padding, height, and font-family. When the input field is focused, it removes the border and adds a box-shadow with a primary color.\n\nThe `AutoCompletingInput` component uses React hooks to manage state and side effects. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the temporary value of the input field, which is initially set to the value passed in as a prop. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the input element, which is used to set the selection range of the input field. Lastly, it uses the `useEffect` hook to update the temporary value when the value prop changes.\n\nThe component listens for keyboard events on the input field using the `onKeyDown` event handler. If the enter key is pressed, it calls the `onSelect` callback function with the current value of the input field and blurs the input field. If the escape key is pressed, it blurs the input field without calling the `onSelect` callback function.\n\nThe component also listens for input events on the input field using the `onInput` event handler. It checks if the current value of the input field matches any of the options passed in as a prop. If there is a match, it sets the temporary value to the matched option and sets the selection range of the input field to highlight the remaining characters. If there is no match or the backspace key is pressed, it sets the temporary value to the current value of the input field.\n\nThe component provides optional callbacks for when the input field is focused or blurred using the `onFocus` and `onBlur` event handlers. When the input field is focused, it selects the entire value of the input field. When the input field is blurred, it checks if the temporary value matches any of the options passed in as a prop. If it does, it calls the `onSelect` callback function with the temporary value. If it doesn't, it sets the temporary value to the value passed in as a prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to provide autocompletion functionality for input fields. For example, it can be used in a search bar to suggest search terms as the user types. Here is an example usage of the `AutoCompletingInput` component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport AutoCompletingInput from './AutoCompletingInput';\n\nconst options = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'];\n\nconst SearchBar = () => {\n  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');\n  const handleSelect = (val) => {\n    setValue(val);\n    // perform search with selected value\n  };\n  return (\n    <AutoCompletingInput\n      options={options}\n      value={value}\n      onSelect={handleSelect}\n      placeholder=\"Search...\"\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default SearchBar;\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `opposite` function?\n- The `opposite` function takes a `PointyTriangleDirection` argument and returns the opposite direction (e.g. if the argument is `'top'`, it returns `'bottom'`). This is used to set the border style of the `PointyTriangleWrapper` component to create the triangle shape.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/PointyTriangle.md"}}],["472",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/PopupDropdown.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `PopupDropdown`. This component is a dropdown menu that appears in a popup when clicked. It is built using the `semantic-ui-react` library and the `lodash` library's `omit` function. \n\nThe `PopupDropdown` component accepts several props, including `position`, `options`, `sections`, `MenuComponent`, `onOpen`, and `onClose`. The `position` prop determines where the popup will appear relative to the dropdown button. The `options` prop is an array of objects that represent the items in the dropdown menu. The `sections` prop is an array of arrays of objects that represent sections of the dropdown menu. The `MenuComponent` prop is the component that will be used to render the dropdown menu. The `onOpen` and `onClose` props are functions that will be called when the popup is opened and closed, respectively.\n\nThe `PopupDropdown` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the popup is open or closed. It also uses the `useCallback` hook to create memoized versions of the `handleOpen` and `handleClose` functions. These functions are used to set the `isOpen` state and call the `onOpen` and `onClose` props, respectively.\n\nThe `PopupDropdown` component uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `content` variable. This variable is the JSX that will be rendered inside the popup. It includes a `Dropdown` component from `semantic-ui-react` that renders the dropdown menu items. The `makeDropdownItem` function is used to create each dropdown menu item. This function takes an object representing the item and an index and returns a `Dropdown.Item` component. The `onClick` prop of the `Dropdown.Item` component is set to a function that calls the `handleClose` function and the `onClick` prop of the original item object, if it exists.\n\nThe `PopupDropdown` component returns a `Popup` component from `semantic-ui-react` that wraps the `content` variable. The `popperModifiers` prop is used to disable the `preventOverflow` and `flip` modifiers of the `popper.js` library that `semantic-ui-react` uses for positioning. The `PopupDropdown` component is memoized using the `memo` function from `react` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\nOverall, the `PopupDropdown` component provides a customizable dropdown menu that appears in a popup when clicked. It can be used in the larger `weave` project to provide a user interface for selecting options or navigating to different pages. Here is an example of how the `PopupDropdown` component might be used:\n\n```\nimport {PopupDropdown} from 'weave';\n\nconst options = [\n  {text: 'Option 1', value: 1},\n  {text: 'Option 2', value: 2},\n  {text: 'Option 3', value: 3},\n];\n\nconst sections = [\n  [\n    {text: 'Section 1 Option 1', value: 11},\n    {text: 'Section 1 Option 2', value: 12},\n  ],\n  [\n    {text: 'Section 2 Option 1', value: 21},\n    {text: 'Section 2 Option 2', value: 22},\n  ],\n];\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <PopupDropdown\n      options={options}\n      sections={sections}\n      onOpen={() => console.log('Popup opened')}\n      onClose={() => console.log('Popup closed')}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to share state between components in the dashboard. \n\nThe interface, `RepoInsightsDashboardState`, defines the shape of the state object that will be shared. It includes properties for the start and end dates of the data being displayed, the number of items to display per page, the name of the repository being viewed, and a `frame` object that can be used to store additional data.\n\nThe `RepoInsightsDashboardContext` is created using the `React.createContext` method, which creates a new context object. The context object is used to share the state defined in the `RepoInsightsDashboardState` interface between components in the dashboard. \n\nBy default, the context object is initialized with default values for the state properties. These default values are set to the current date for the start and end dates, 0 for the page size, an empty string for the repository name, and an empty object for the `frame` property.\n\nComponents in the dashboard can access the state values by using the `useContext` hook provided by React. For example, a component that needs to display the current repository name could use the following code:\n\n```\nimport { RepoInsightsDashboardContext } from 'weave';\n\nfunction RepositoryName() {\n  const { repoName } = useContext(RepoInsightsDashboardContext);\n\n  return <h1>{repoName}</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nThis code uses the `useContext` hook to access the `repoName` property from the `RepoInsightsDashboardContext`.

The `onChange` prop is also required and is called whenever the content of the `span` changes. The `onBlur` prop is called when the `span` loses focus. The `onFocus` prop is called when the `span` gains focus. The `onKeyDown` prop is called when a key is pressed down while the `span` is in focus. The `onPaste` prop is called when the user pastes content into the `span`. The `onTempChange` prop is called whenever the content of the `span` changes, but before the `onChange` prop is called.\n\nThe `className` prop is an optional CSS class name to apply to the `span`. The `innerRef` prop is an optional ref to the `span` element. The `disabled` prop is an optional boolean that disables the content-editable `span` if set to `true`.\n\nThe `StrippedContentEditable` component uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to update the content of the `span` element whenever the `value` prop changes.

For example, if the project involves manipulating images, the `Rasterize` function can be used to convert the image data into a format that can be displayed on a canvas. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Rasterize` function can be used:\n\n```\nconst imageData = // pixel data for an image\nconst canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\nconst ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\nconst params = { imageData, canvas, ctx };\nRasterize(params);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `imageData` variable contains the pixel data for an image. The `canvas` variable creates a new canvas element, and the `ctx` variable gets the 2D context of the canvas. The `params` object contains the `imageData`, `canvas`, and `ctx` properties, which are passed into the `Rasterize` function. The `Rasterize` function then converts the `imageData` into a canvas bitmap, which can be displayed on the canvas.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Rasterize` function and what parameters does it take?\n- The purpose of the `Rasterize` function is to convert pixel data into a canvas bitmap. The code does not provide information on the specific parameters that the function takes.\n\n2. What is the `Definition` object and what information does it contain?\n- The `Definition` object is a property of the `Rasterize` namespace. It contains information about the function, including its type, metadata, and parameters.\n\n3. Why is the `no-redeclare` comment used on the `declare namespace Rasterize` line?\n- The `no-redeclare` comment is used to disable the ESLint rule that prevents redeclaring variables. In this case, the `Rasterize` namespace is being redeclared, but it is intentional and necessary for the code to work properly.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/Vega3/Rasterize.d.md"}}],["482",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/Vega3/Rasterize.js)\n\nThe `Rasterize` function in the `weave` project is responsible for converting pixel data into a canvas bitmap. This function is defined using the `Transform` class from the `vega-dataflow` library. The purpose of this function is to generate a canvas image from a set of input data. \n\nThe `Rasterize` function takes in an object of parameters, including `x`, `y`, `color`, `width`, `height`, and `as`. The `x` and `y` parameters are required and represent the x and y coordinates of the pixel data. The `color` parameter is also required and represents the color of the pixel data. The `width` and `height` parameters are optional and represent the width and height of the canvas image. The `as` parameter is also optional and represents the name of the canvas image.\n\nThe `transform` method of the `Rasterize` function is responsible for generating the canvas image. This method takes in a `pulse` object, which represents the input data. The method first checks if the `pulse` object has any data. If there is no data, the method returns the `pulse` object. If there is data, the method creates a new `pulse` object and initializes the `out` variable to this new object. \n\nThe method then extracts the `x`, `y`, `color`, `as`, `width`, and `height` parameters from the input object. It then creates an empty array called `arr` and initializes `maxX` and `maxY` variables to 0. \n\nThe method then iterates over the input data using the `pulse.visit` method. For each data point, the method extracts the `x` and `y` coordinates and updates `maxX` and `maxY` if necessary. It then pushes the data point onto the `arr` array. \n\nThe method then creates a new canvas using the `canvas` method from the `vega-canvas` library. It sets the width and height of the canvas to `cw` and `ch`, respectively. If `width` and `height` are not provided, `cw` and `ch` are set to `maxX + 1` and `maxY + 1`, respectively. The method then gets the 2D context of the canvas using the `getContext` method and creates a new image data object using the `getImageData` method. \n\nThe method then iterates over the `arr` array and sets the color of each pixel in the canvas image using the `rgb` method from the `d3-color` library. It then puts the image data onto the canvas using the `putImageData` method. Finally, the method adds the canvas image to the `out` object using the `push` method and sets the `value` and `source` properties of the `Rasterize` object to `out.add`. \n\nOverall, the `Rasterize` function is an important part of the `weave` project as it allows users to generate canvas images from pixel data. This function can be used in a variety of ways, such as generating heatmaps or visualizing image data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport Rasterize from 'weave';\n\nconst data = [\n  {x: 0, y: 0, color: '#FF0000'},\n  {x: 1, y: 1, color: '#00FF00'},\n  {x: 2, y: 2, color: '#0000FF'},\n];\n\nconst params = {\n  x: d => d.x,\n  y: d => d.y,\n  color: d => d.color,\n  width: 300,\n  height: 300,\n  as: 'myCanvas',\n};\n\nconst rasterize = new Rasterize(params);\nconst result = rasterize.transform(data, pulse);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a function called `Rasterize` that converts pixel data into a canvas bitmap. It uses the `vega-canvas` and `vega-dataflow` libraries to generate a canvas and manipulate pixel data.\n\n2. What are the input requirements for the `Rasterize` function?\n    \n    The `Rasterize` function requires four input parameters: `x`, `y`, `color`, and `as`. `x` and `y` are field parameters that are required and must be specified. `color` is an expression parameter that is also required. `as` is an optional string parameter that specifies the name of the output field.\n\n3. What does the `transform` method of the `Rasterize` prototype do?\n    \n    The `transform` method of the `Rasterize` prototype takes in two parameters: `_` and `pulse`. It generates a canvas and manipulates pixel data based on the input parameters. It then adds the canvas to the output and returns the name of the output field.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/Vega3/Rasterize.md"}}],["483",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/Vega3/vegaSpecPatches.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports a single function called `patchWBVegaSpec`. This function takes a `VisualizationSpec` object as input and returns a modified version of the same object. The purpose of this function is to patch the `vega-lite` specs supplied to `react-vega`.\n\nThe `patchWBVegaSpec` function uses the `immer` library to create a mutable copy of the input `spec` object. It then applies a series of patches to this copy by calling each function in the `vegaSpecPatches` array. The `vegaSpecPatches` array is a list of functions that take a `VisualizationSpec` object as input and return a modified version of the same object. The `patchScaleToNull` function is the only patch function currently in the array.\n\nThe `patchScaleToNull` function replaces all instances of `{scale: {}}` with `{scale: null}` in the `spec`. This is necessary because the `deepMapArraysAndValues` function used in the `CustomPanelRenderer` converts object leaf nodes that are null to `{}`. However, `scale` needs to be null for reading data that is directly encoded as values (i.e., has no scale). Therefore, the `patchScaleToNull` function manually sets `scale` to null.\n\nThe `patchWBVegaSpec` function is the only function that this file exports. It applies all the patches in the `vegaSpecPatches` array to the input `spec` object and returns the modified version.

The component is composed of a `WBPopup` component and a `PointyTriangle` component that renders a triangle pointing towards the anchor element.\n\nThe `WBAnchoredPopup` component takes several props, including `className`, `direction`, `triangleColor`, `triangleSize`, `anchorElement`, `maxHeight`, `children`, `onParentScroll`, `scrollerRef`, and `onScroll`. The `anchorElement` prop is required and specifies the element to which the popup is anchored. The `direction` prop specifies the direction of the popup relative to the anchor element. The `triangleColor` and `triangleSize` props specify the color and size of the triangle pointing towards the anchor element. The `maxHeight` prop specifies the maximum height of the popup. The `onParentScroll` prop specifies how the popup should behave when the parent element is scrolled. The `scrollerRef` prop is a reference to the scrollable element that contains the popup. The `onScroll` prop is a callback function that is called when the popup is scrolled.\n\nThe `WBAnchoredPopup` component uses the `getScrollParent` function to determine the scrollable parent element of the anchor element. It then listens for scroll events on the parent element and updates the position of the popup accordingly. The component also uses the `IntersectionObserver` API to observe changes to the position of the anchor element and update the position of the popup accordingly.\n\nThe `WBAnchoredPopup` component renders the `WBPopup` and `PointyTriangle` components inside a `Wrapper` component. The `WBPopup` component is responsible for rendering the actual popup content, while the `PointyTriangle` component renders the triangle pointing towards the anchor element.

The `Wrapper` component is a `div` element that is positioned `fixed` to the top-left corner of the screen, with a width and height of `100%`. The `pointer-events` property is set to `none`, which means that the overlay will not capture any mouse or touch events, allowing the user to interact with the content underneath. \n\nThe `filter` property applies a drop shadow effect to the overlay, which helps to visually separate it from the content underneath.

The `samplingRate` prop is used to determine whether or not to log the data based on a random number generator.\n\nOverall, the `WandbLoader` and `TrackedWandbLoader` components are used to display a loading spinner and track the component's lifecycle for analytics purposes. These components can be used throughout the Weave project to provide a consistent loading experience and gather data about how long components take to load. An example usage of the `TrackedWandbLoader` component might look like this:\n\n```\nimport { TrackedWandbLoader } from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TrackedWandbLoader name=\"my-component\" />\n      <p>This is my component</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes two props: `helpText` which is the text to be displayed in the popup, and `docUrl` which is an optional URL to a documentation page. \n\nThe component uses the `Icon` and `Popup` components from the `semantic-ui-react` library to render the help icon and the popup respectively. The `TargetBlank` component from the `util/links` module is used to render the `docUrl` prop as a hyperlink that opens in a new tab.\n\nThe `popup` variable is assigned the `Popup` component with the `inverted`, `size`, `className`, `trigger`, and `content` props set. The `inverted` prop sets the popup to have a dark background with light text, while the `size` prop sets the size of the popup to \"mini\". The `className` prop sets the class name of the popup content to \"help-popup-content\". The `trigger` prop sets the help icon as the trigger for the popup, while the `content` prop sets the `helpText` prop as the content of the popup.\n\nThe `returnVal` variable is assigned a ternary expression that checks if the `docUrl` prop is not null. If it is not null, the `TargetBlank` component is used to wrap the `popup` variable, passing the `docUrl` prop as the `href` prop. If it is null, the `popup` variable is returned as is.\n\nFinally, the component returns a `span` element with the class name \"help-popup\" and the `returnVal` variable as its child.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide help text and documentation links for various UI elements. For example, a button component could use this `HelpPopup` component to display a help icon with a popup containing information on what the button does, as well as a link to the documentation page for the button. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<HelpPopup helpText=\"Click this button to submit the form\" docUrl=\"https://example.com/docs/form-submit\" />\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes in an array of strings representing the keys to be displayed, as well as an optional boolean `lightMode` flag and a `className` string for styling purposes. \n\nThe component is composed of two styled components: `Keys` and `Key`. `Keys` is a container component that displays its children (the `Key` components) in a horizontal row using the `display: inline-flex` CSS property. `Key` is a component that displays a single keyboard key, with a colored background and rounded corners. The `lightMode` flag determines the color scheme of the component, with a lighter color scheme used when `lightMode` is true.\n\nThe `KeyboardShortcut` component maps over the `keys` prop and renders a `Key` component for each key in the array. The `Key` component displays the key text and applies the appropriate background color and text color based on the `lightMode` flag.\n\nThis component could be used in a larger project to display keyboard shortcuts to users in a visually appealing way. For example, a code editor application could use this component to display the keyboard shortcuts for various commands.

The component provides a text input field that accepts numerical values, and can be configured with various options such as minimum and maximum values, step size, and tick marks. It also provides an optional stepper control that allows the user to increment or decrement the value using up and down arrows.\n\nThe component is implemented as a functional component that accepts a set of properties as input. These properties include the initial value of the input field, the minimum and maximum allowed values, and various styling options. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the current value of the input field, and the `useEffect` hook to update the value when the `value` property changes.\n\nThe `shiftValue` function is used to update the value of the input field when the user clicks on the stepper controls or uses the up and down arrow keys. It takes the current value of the input field, the direction of the change (up or down), and the step size as input, and computes the new value based on these inputs. If tick marks are specified, the new value is rounded to the nearest tick mark. If no tick marks are specified, the new value is incremented or decremented by the step size.\n\nThe `NumberInput` component is exported as a default export, which means that it can be imported into other modules using the `import` statement.

If the text exceeds the maximum width, it will overflow with no line wrap and an ellipsis. \n\nThe `SingleLineText` component accepts several props, including `children`, `maxWidth`, `as`, `alignSelf`, and `className`. The `children` prop is required and represents the text to be rendered. The `maxWidth` prop is optional and specifies the maximum width of the text. The `as` prop is also optional and specifies the HTML element to be used for rendering the text (default is `span`). The `alignSelf` prop is optional and specifies the alignment of the text within its container. The `className` prop is optional and allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the rendered text.\n\nThe `SingleLineText` component uses the `pickNameProps` function from the `reactUtils` module to extract any `name` props from the component's props. It then uses the `classNames` function from the `classnames` module to generate a CSS class string for the rendered text. The `singleLineTextClass` constant is used as a base class for the generated class string.

It would require examining the implementation of the `TextInputNew` component to determine its differences from `TextInput`.\n3. What is the purpose of the `FC` type in the import statement for React?\n   - The `FC` type is a shorthand for the `FunctionComponent` type, which is a type definition for a React functional component. It is used to define the type of the `TextInput` component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/TextInput.md"}}],["501",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/TextInput.styles.ts)\n\nThis code defines three styled components that can be used in the larger project called \"weave\". The first component is called \"Input\" and is a styled version of the Semantic UI React Input component. It sets the width to 100% and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original Input component.\n\nThe second component is called \"Label\" and is a styled label element. It sets the display to block, sets the font weight to six times the standard font weight, sets the font size to 1.222 times the standard font size, sets the line height to 1.5 times the standard line height, and sets the margin bottom to half of the standard spacing unit. This component can be used to create labels for form inputs.\n\nThe third component is called \"Sublabel\" and is a styled span element. It sets the color to a gray color defined in the global styles file. This component can be used to create sublabels for form inputs.\n\nThese components can be imported and used in other files within the \"weave\" project. For example, the Input component can be used in a form component like this:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {Input, Label, Sublabel} from './components';\n\nconst MyForm = () => {\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <Label>First Name</Label>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter your first name\" />\n      <Sublabel>This is your given name.</Sublabel>\n      <Label>Last Name</Label>\n      <Input placeholder=\"Enter your last name\" />\n      <Sublabel>This is your family name.</Sublabel>\n    </form>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThis code creates a form with two inputs, each with a label and sublabel. The labels and sublabels are styled using the Label and Sublabel components defined in the code above. The Input components are styled using the Input component defined in the code above.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of importing from 'semantic-ui-react'?\n- The code is importing the `Input` component from the 'semantic-ui-react' library to use in the `Input` styled component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `calc()` function used in the `Label` styled component?\n- The `calc()` function is used to perform calculations with CSS values. In this case, it is used to calculate the font-weight, font-size, and line-height values based on the standard values defined in the `globals.styles` file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Sublabel` styled component?\n- The `Sublabel` styled component is used to style a span element that will be used as a sublabel for the `Input` component.

The component takes in four props: `dataTest`, `onChange`, `placeholder`, and `value`. \n\nThe `dataTest` prop is a string used for testing purposes. The `onChange` prop is a function that is called whenever the input value changes. It takes in two arguments: a synthetic event and an object containing the new input value. The `placeholder` prop is an optional string that displays as a hint inside the input field when it is empty. The `value` prop is an optional string that sets the initial value of the input field.\n\nThe `TextInput` component is defined as a functional component using the `FC` type from React. It is wrapped in the `React.memo` higher-order component to optimize performance by memoizing the component and only re-rendering it when its props change.\n\nThe `TextInput` component returns an `Input` component that renders the actual input field. The `Input` component is defined using the `styled-components` library and extends the `SemanticInput` component from `semantic-ui-react`. It applies custom styles to the input field by targeting the `input` element inside the `SemanticInput` component.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project as a reusable input field component that can be styled and customized using the `styled-components` library.

The module imports React, createElement, and FC from the 'react' library, and toastify, ToastifyContainer, ToastContent, and ToastOptions from the 'react-toastify' library. It also imports LegacyWBIcon from another module in the project.\n\nThe ToastContainer component is a functional component that returns a ToastifyContainer component from the 'react-toastify' library. The ToastifyContainer component is a container for toast notifications that appear on the screen. The ToastContainer component sets the position of the toast notifications to the top right of the screen, hides the progress bar, and sets the class names for the container and the toast notifications. The component also sets a custom close button for the toast notifications using the closeButton prop. The closeButton prop is a function that returns a LegacyWBIcon component from another module in the project. The LegacyWBIcon component is an icon that is used as the close button for the toast notifications.\n\nThe toast function is a wrapper around the toastify function from the 'react-toastify' library. The toast function takes two arguments: text and options. The text argument is the message that will be displayed in the toast notification. The options argument is an optional object that can be used to customize the toast notification. The toast function simply calls the toastify function with the text and options arguments.\n\nOverall, this module provides a way to display toast notifications in the project using the 'react-toastify' library. The ToastContainer component provides a container for the toast notifications, and the toast function provides a simple way to display the notifications. The LegacyWBIcon component is used as the close button for the toast notifications, and it is imported from another module in the project. This module can be used in any part of the project where toast notifications need to be displayed. For example, it can be used to display success or error messages after a user performs an action on the website. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {ToastContainer, toast} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    // perform some action\n    toast('Action completed successfully!');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Perform Action</button>\n      <ToastContainer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What are the available options for the `toast` function and how are they used?\n- The `toast` function takes in a `text` parameter for the content of the toast notification and an optional `options` parameter for additional configuration. The `toastify` function from the `react-toastify` library is used to actually display the notification.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/Toast.md"}}],["504",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/WBButtonNew.tsx)\n\nThe code defines two React components, `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink`, which are styled Semantic UI buttons with additional custom styles. The `WBButton` component is a regular button, while `WBButtonLink` is a button that is also a link. Both components accept two optional props: `variant` and `size`. `variant` can be one of three values: `ghost`, `confirm`, or `plain`. `size` can be one of three values: `icon`, `small`, or `medium`. \n\nThe `buttonStyles` constant defines the custom styles for the buttons. It uses the `css` function from the `styled-components` library to conditionally apply styles based on the `variant` and `size` props. For example, if `variant` is `ghost`, the button will have transparent background and text color that changes to teal on hover. If `size` is `icon`, the button will have smaller padding.\n\nThe `ButtonStyled` and `ButtonLinkStyled` constants are styled Semantic UI `Button` and `Link` components, respectively, with the custom styles from `buttonStyles` applied. The `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components are defined as memoized functional components that render `ButtonStyled` and `ButtonLinkStyled`, respectively, with all props passed through. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to create consistent, customizable buttons and button links that match the project's design system. For example, a developer could use `WBButton` to create a \"Save\" button with the `confirm` variant and `medium` size:\n\n```\n<WBButton variant=\"confirm\" size=\"medium\">Save</WBButton>\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components?\n- The `WBButton` and `WBButtonLink` components are React functional components that render styled `Button` and `Link` components respectively, with additional props for specifying the button variant and size.\n\n2. What are the possible values for the `variant` and `size` props?\n- The `variant` prop can have the values `ghost`, `confirm`, or `plain`, while the `size` prop can have the values `icon`, `small`, or `medium`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `buttonStyles` constant?\n- The `buttonStyles` constant is a styled-component CSS template literal that defines the common styles for the `Button` and `Link` components, including the button variant and size styles based on the props passed to them.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/WBButtonNew.md"}}],["505",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/components/elements/WBQueryMenu.tsx)\n\nThe `WBQueryMenu` component is a React component that extends the `WBMenu` component. It is designed to provide a menu with options that can be fetched from an API or provided as an array. The component supports infinite scrolling and sorting of options based on a score function. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `options`, `scrollerElement`, `scrollThreshold`, `pageSize`, `sortScoreFn`, `infiniteScroll`, and `onResolvedOptions`. The `options` prop can either be an array of `WBMenuOption` objects or a function that returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with an array of `WBMenuOption` objects and a `nextPageCursor` string. The `scrollerElement` prop is an optional `HTMLElement` that is used as the scroll container for infinite scrolling. The `scrollThreshold` prop is the number of pixels from the bottom of the scroll container at which point the component will load more options. The `pageSize` prop is the number of options to fetch at a time. The `sortScoreFn` prop is a function that takes in a `WBMenuOption` object and returns a number that is used to sort the options. The `infiniteScroll` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not to use infinite scrolling. The `onResolvedOptions` prop is a function that is called with the resolved options when they are fetched.\n\nThe component uses `React.useState` to manage the state of the component, including `loading`, `computedOptions`, and `nextPageCursor`. It also uses `React.useRef` to keep track of the last query that was run. The component uses `React.useEffect` to handle the fetching of options and to add and remove event listeners for scrolling. \n\nIf the `options` prop is a function, the component will fetch the initial options and set the `loading` state to `true`. Once the options are fetched, the `loading` state is set to `false`, the `computedOptions` state is set to the fetched options, and the `onResolvedOptions` prop is called with the fetched options. If the `options` prop is an array, the component will set the `computedOptions` state to the array of options and call the `onResolvedOptions` prop with the options. \n\nIf `infiniteScroll` is `true`, the component will add an event listener to the `scrollerElement` that will call the `loadMore` function when the user scrolls to the bottom of the container. The `loadMore` function will fetch more options and add them to the `computedOptions` state. If `infiniteScroll` is `false`, the component will sort the `computedOptions` state based on the `sortScoreFn` prop.\n\nThe `modifiedOptions` variable is used to modify the `computedOptions` state based on the `loading` state. If `loading` is `true`, a loading option is added to the end of the `computedOptions` state. If `computedOptions` is empty, a \"No matches\" option is added to the `modifiedOptions` state.\n\nThe component returns the `WBMenu` component with the `modifiedOptions` state as the `options` prop. The `ref` prop is used to set the `defaultScrollerElement` state.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `WBMenuOptionFetcher` type?\n- The `WBMenuOptionFetcher` type is a function type that defines the shape of a function that fetches menu options. It takes in an object with a cursor and count property and returns a promise that resolves to an object with nextPageCursor and options properties.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `infiniteScroll` prop?\n- The `infiniteScroll` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not the menu options should be loaded infinitely as the user scrolls.

This component is likely used to display a loading animation or spinner in the UI of the larger project. \n\n`DisabledItem` is a more complex component that is styled to appear disabled. It has a gray color (#bbb), smaller font size (14px), and reduced line height (16px). It also has padding on the top and bottom (8px) and left and right (16px) to provide some spacing around the content. This component is likely used to display disabled or inactive items in a list or menu. It has a cursor set to \"pointer\" to indicate that it is clickable, but the `color` property makes it appear grayed out and unresponsive. \n\nBoth components have a `position` property set to \"relative\", which means they will be positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. This allows for more precise positioning using the `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` properties. \n\nOverall, these components provide a consistent and reusable way to style loading and disabled elements in the larger project.

The suggestion menu is a popup that appears below the input element and displays a list of options that match the current query string. The suggestion menu is rendered using the `SuggestionMenu` component, which is imported from the `@wandb/ui` library.\n\nThe `WBSuggester` component filters the options based on the current query string and renders the filtered options using the `SuggestionMenu` component.

It can be used to fetch options from a server or use hardcoded options, and supports infinite scrolling and custom sorting.\n\n2. What are the required props for using this component?\n- The required props are `children`, which is a function that returns a React node that will be used as the input element for the autocompleter, and `onSelect`, which is a callback function that will be called when an option is selected from the suggestion menu.\n\n3. What is the default behavior of the autocompleter and how can it be customized?\n- By default, the autocompleter will filter the options based on the user's input and display them in a suggestion menu below the input element.

The `SuggestionPopupFlexWrapper` component is a simple wrapper that displays its children in a row format. \n\nThe `SuggestionMenu` component is a styled version of the `WBQueryMenu` component, which is a dropdown menu that displays a list of options. The `SuggestionMenu` component takes in a prop called `$maxHeight`, which sets the maximum height of the menu. The `css` function from `styled-components` is used to set the `max-height` property of the menu based on the value of `$maxHeight`. The `overflow-y` property is set to `scroll` to allow the menu to scroll if it exceeds the maximum height. The `z-index` property is set to `1` to ensure that the menu appears above other elements on the screen. The `&::-webkit-scrollbar` selector is used to remove the scrollbar from the menu in Firefox. \n\nThe `SuggestionContext` component is a simple container that positions its children relative to the left edge of the screen. \n\nThe `Option` component is a styled version of a `div` element that represents an individual option in the suggestion menu. It takes in a prop called `hovered`, which is used to determine whether the option is currently being hovered over by the user. If the option is being hovered over, the background color is set to the primary color defined in the global colors file. \n\nOverall, these styled components work together to create a visually appealing and functional suggestion menu feature for the larger \"weave\" project.

Initially, the list is closed (`open` is set to `false`). When the icon is clicked, the `onClick` function toggles the value of `open` to show or hide the full list. \n\nThe component renders a `div` that contains an icon and the child elements. The icon is an instance of the `LegacyWBIcon` component, which is imported from another file in the project. The icon is styled to rotate 90 degrees when the list is open, and has a cursor pointer to indicate that it is clickable. The child elements are contained within another `div` that has a `maxHeight` property set to `undefined` when the list is open, allowing the full list to be displayed. When the list is closed, the `maxHeight` property is set to `32`, which limits the height of the list and hides any elements that exceed that height. \n\nThe `ShowMoreContainer` component is exported as a memoized version of the `ShowMoreContainerComp` function using the `React.memo` method.

It includes properties such as `mouseDownEvent`, `dragData`, `dragRef`, `dropRef`, `dragStarted`, `dragging`, `clientXY`, `shiftKey`, and several functions that can be used to update the state.\n\nThe `DragDropProvider` component initializes the state using the `useState` hook and provides the state and functions to the context using the `useMemo` hook. It also sets up event listeners for `mouseup` and `dragover` events. The `mouseup` event listener is used to clear the `dragRef` when the mouse button is released. The `dragover` event listener is used to set the `clientXY` property in the state object when the `dragover` event is fired. This is necessary because Firefox does not provide the `clientX` and `clientY` properties on the `drag` event.\n\nThe `useDragDropContext` hook can be used to consume the state and functions provided by the `DragDropContext`. This hook returns the current value of the context using the `useContext` hook.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to manage drag and drop functionality in a React application. The `DragDropProvider` component can be used to wrap components that need access to the drag and drop state and functions, and the `useDragDropContext` hook can be used to consume the state and functions in those components.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides a Drag and Drop context for React applications, allowing users to drag and drop elements within the application. It solves the problem of needing to implement drag and drop functionality from scratch.\n\n2. What are the different states and functions being managed by this code?\n- The code manages various states related to drag and drop functionality, including mouse events, drag data, drag and drop references, and shift key modifiers. It also provides functions to set these states.\n\n3. How does this code handle browser compatibility issues?\n- The code includes a workaround for a browser compatibility issue in Firefox, which does not provide clientX and clientY values on drag events. It adds an event handler to document.dragover and stores the result in the context to address this issue.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DragDropContextProvider.md"}}],["511",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DragHandle.tsx)\n\nThe code above is a React component that provides a drag handle for a draggable element. It is part of the larger project called Weave. The component is imported from two other files, `DragDropContextProvider` and `types`. \n\nThe `DragHandle` component takes in four props: `partRef`, `children`, `className`, and `style`. `partRef` is a reference to the draggable element that the handle is associated with. `children` is the content that will be displayed inside the handle. `className` and `style` are optional props that allow for custom styling of the handle.\n\nThe component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `DragDropContext` object, which is provided by the `DragDropContextProvider`. The `DragDropContext` object contains two functions, `setDragRef` and `setMouseDownEvent`, which are used to set the reference to the draggable element and the mouse down event, respectively.\n\nWhen the handle is clicked (`onMouseDown`), the `setDragRef` function is called with the `partRef` prop, which sets the reference to the draggable element. The `setMouseDownEvent` function is also called with the mouse down event, which is used to calculate the drag distance when the element is dragged.\n\nThe `DragHandle` component returns a `div` element with the `drag-drop-handle` class and any additional classes passed in through the `className` prop. The `style` prop is used to apply any custom styles to the handle. The `children` prop is rendered inside the `div` element.\n\nThe `DragHandle` component is memoized using the `memo` function, which improves performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of the component.\n\nThis component can be used in conjunction with other components in the Weave project to create draggable elements with drag handles. For example, a user could drag a chart element by clicking and dragging on the drag handle. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<DragHandle partRef={chartRef} className=\"chart-drag-handle\">\n  <div className=\"drag-handle-icon\">Drag</div>\n</DragHandle>\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `DragHandle` component?\n   - The `DragHandle` component is used as a handle for drag and drop functionality in the `weave` project.\n\n2. What is the `DragDropContext` and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `DragDropContext` is imported from `./DragDropContextProvider` and is used to provide context for drag and drop functionality in the `DragHandleComp` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `memo` function in the export statement?\n   - The `memo` function is used to memoize the `DragHandleComp` component, which can improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DragHandle.md"}}],["512",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DragSource.tsx)\n\nThe `DragSource` component is a React component that provides drag-and-drop functionality to its children. It is part of the larger `weave` project and is used to enable drag-and-drop interactions between different parts of the application.\n\nThe `DragSource` component takes several props, including `children`, `partRef`, `data`, `className`, `style`, `draggingStyle`, `callbackRef`, `onMouseUp`, `onDragStart`, and `onDragEnd`. The `children` prop is the content that will be draggable, while the `partRef` prop is a reference to the part of the component that should be draggable. The `data` prop is an optional object that can be used to store data about the drag operation, while the `className`, `style`, and `draggingStyle` props are used to style the component. The `callbackRef`, `onMouseUp`, `onDragStart`, and `onDragEnd` props are callbacks that can be used to handle various events during the drag operation.\n\nThe `DragSource` component uses the `useContext` hook to get access to the `DragDropContext`, which provides information about the current drag-and-drop state. It then uses this information to determine whether the component should be draggable and whether it is currently being dragged. If the component is being dragged, it applies the `draggingStyle` prop to the component to indicate that it is being dragged.\n\nThe `DragSource` component also handles various drag-and-drop events, such as `onDrag`, `onDragStart`, and `onDragEnd`. During the `onDrag` event, it checks whether the user is dragging near the top or bottom of the page and automatically scrolls the window if necessary. It also checks whether the user has pressed or released the shift key and updates the drag-and-drop state accordingly. During the `onDragStart` event, it sets the drag-and-drop state to indicate that the drag operation has started and sets the drag data if the `data` prop is provided. Finally, during the `onDragEnd` event, it resets the drag-and-drop state to its initial values.\n\nOverall, the `DragSource` component provides a simple way to enable drag-and-drop interactions between different parts of the `weave` application. It handles many of the details of the drag-and-drop operation, such as styling the component during the drag operation and handling various drag-and-drop events. Developers can use this component to quickly add drag-and-drop functionality to their own components without having to worry about the underlying implementation details.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What external libraries does this code use?\n- This code imports `classnames`, `lodash`, and `React`.\n\n3. What props does the `DragSource` component accept?\n- The `DragSource` component accepts several props including `children`, `partRef`, `data`, `className`, `style`, `draggingStyle`, `callbackRef`, `onMouseUp`, `onDragStart`, and `onDragEnd`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DragSource.md"}}],["513",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/containers/DragDropContainer/DropTarget.tsx)\n\nThe `DropTarget` component is a React functional component that provides a drop target for drag-and-drop operations. It is part of the `weave` project and is used to enable drag-and-drop functionality in other components of the project. \n\nThe component accepts several props, including `children`, `className`, `style`, and several event handlers such as `onDragOver`, `onDragStart`, `onDragEnter`, `onDragLeave`, and `onDrop`. It also accepts a `isValidDropTarget` prop, which is a function that determines whether the drop target is valid based on the current drag-and-drop context. If this function is not provided, the default behavior is to allow all drop targets.\n\nWhen the component is rendered, it uses the `useContext` hook to get the current drag-and-drop context from the `DragDropContextProvider`. It then uses this context to determine whether the drop target is valid and to call the appropriate event handlers when drag-and-drop events occur.\n\nFor example, when the `onDragOver` event occurs, the component prevents the default behavior and stops the event from propagating. It then checks whether the drag-and-drop context is valid and whether the drop target has changed. If the drop target has changed, it updates the context with the new drop target. Finally, it calls the `onDragOver` event handler if it is provided.\n\nSimilarly, when the `onDrop` event occurs, the component checks whether the drag-and-drop context is valid and calls the `onDrop` event handler if it is provided. It then resets the drag-and-drop context to its initial state.\n\nThe `DropTarget` component is memoized using the `memo` function to improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. This means that the component will only re-render if its props or state have changed.\n\nOverall, the `DropTarget` component provides a flexible and reusable drop target for drag-and-drop operations in the `weave` project. It can be used in conjunction with other components to enable drag-and-drop functionality in a variety of contexts.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `DropTarget` component?\n- The `DropTarget` component is used to define a drop target for drag and drop interactions in a React application.\n\n2.

The `DragDropContextProvider` module provides a context provider for drag and drop functionality, allowing components to interact with each other through drag and drop actions. The `DragHandle` module provides a handle for dragging components, while the `DragSource` module provides a source for dragging components. The `DropTarget` module provides a target for dropping components, and the `types` module provides type definitions for the drag and drop functionality.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger `weave` project to enable drag and drop functionality between components. For example, a user may want to drag a component from one area of the screen to another, and this code would provide the necessary functionality to make that happen. \n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { DragDropContextProvider, DragSource, DropTarget } from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const handleDrag = () => {\n    // handle drag event\n  };\n\n  const handleDrop = () => {\n    // handle drop event\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <DragDropContextProvider>\n      <DragSource onDrag={handleDrag}>\n        <DropTarget onDrop={handleDrop}>\n          <div>My Component</div>\n        </DropTarget>\n      </DragSource>\n    </DragDropContextProvider>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `DragDropContextProvider` wraps the `DragSource` and `DropTarget` components, enabling drag and drop functionality between them. The `onDrag` and `onDrop` props are used to handle the drag and drop events respectively.

What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines styles for various HTML elements like images, tables, headings, code blocks, etc. It is likely part of a larger CSS file for the `weave` project.\n\n2. What is the significance of `globals.less` being imported at the beginning of the file?\n   \n   `globals.less` likely contains global variables and mixins that are used throughout the project. By importing it at the beginning of this file, those variables and mixins can be used in the styles defined here.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `div.center` selector?\n   \n   The `div.center` selector defines styles for a block-level element that should be centered horizontally within its parent container. It is likely used for elements like images or headings that need to be centered on the page.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/css/Markdown.md"}}],["522",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/css/NumberInput.less)\n\nThe code above is a Less file that defines styles for a number input component in the Weave project. The component consists of a container that holds both a stepper and an input field. The stepper allows the user to increment or decrement the value in the input field. \n\nThe `number-input` class is the main class for the component. It contains two child classes: `__container` and `__stepper`. The `__container` class sets the display property to flex, which allows the child elements to be aligned horizontally. The `__stepper` class also sets the display property to flex, but with a column direction. This allows the stepper buttons to be aligned vertically. The `justify-content` property centers the buttons vertically within the container. The `z-index` property sets the stacking order of the stepper buttons, and the `margin-left` property positions the stepper to the left of the input field. The `color` property sets the color of the stepper buttons to a gray color defined in the `globals.less` file.\n\nThe `__input` class sets the width of the input field to 10 times the value of `@spu`, which is a variable defined in the `globals.less` file. This ensures that the input field is wide enough to accommodate the largest possible value.\n\nThis code can be used to style a number input component in the Weave project. To use this component, the developer would need to add the appropriate HTML markup and apply the `number-input` class to the container element. For example:\n\n```\n<div class=\"number-input\">\n  <div class=\"number-input__container\">\n    <div class=\"number-input__stepper\">\n      <button>+</button>\n      <button>-</button>\n    </div>\n    <input type=\"number\" class=\"number-input__input\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThis would create a number input component with stepper buttons and an input field styled according to the code in this file.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `globals.less` file being imported at the beginning of the code?\n   - The `globals.less` file is likely containing global variables and mixins that are used throughout the project, and this code is importing them to use in this file.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `z-index: 0;` property in the `.number-input__stepper` selector?\n   - The `z-index: 0;` property sets the stacking order of the element, indicating that it should be behind other elements with higher z-index values.\n\n3. What is the value of `@gray500` and `@spu` used in this code?\n   - The value of `@gray500` is likely a shade of gray defined in the `globals.less` file, and the value of `@spu` is likely a unit of measurement defined in the same file. Without seeing the values assigned to these variables, it is impossible to know their exact values.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/css/NumberInput.md"}}],["523",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/css/animations.less)\n\nThe code in this file defines several CSS animations using keyframes. These animations can be used in the larger project to add visual effects to various elements on the website. \n\nThe first animation, `slide-down`, moves an element down by 50 pixels using the `translateY` property. The animation starts at 0% and ends at 100%, with the element moving from its starting position to its final position over the course of the animation.\n\nThe second animation, `fade-in`, gradually increases the opacity of an element from 0 to 1. The animation starts at the `from` keyframe and ends at the `to` keyframe, with the element becoming more and more visible as the animation progresses.\n\nThe third animation, `fade-out`, does the opposite of `fade-in`. It gradually decreases the opacity of an element from 1 to 0, making it disappear. \n\nThe fourth animation, `blur-in`, gradually reduces the amount of blur applied to an element from 3 pixels to 0 pixels. This can be used to create a visual effect where an element gradually comes into focus.\n\nFinally, the `@popupAnimation` variable combines three of these animations (`slide-down`, `blur-in`, and `fade-in`) to create a single animation that can be applied to pop-up windows or other elements that need to appear on the screen. The animation lasts for 0.2 seconds and includes all three effects.\n\nTo use these animations in the larger project, developers can apply them to specific elements using CSS. For example, to apply the `fade-in` animation to an element with the class `my-element`, the following CSS code could be used:\n\n```\n.my-element {\n  animation: fade-in 1s;\n}\n```\n\nThis would cause the `my-element` element to gradually become more visible over the course of 1 second.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines several keyframe animations using CSS. It also sets a variable called `@popupAnimation` that combines three of these animations to be used as an animation for popups.\n\n2.

This is useful for tracking changes in state over time. The hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to store the previous value and update it when the value changes.\n\nThe `useDeepMemo` hook is another generic hook that takes a value and an optional equality function. The hook only returns a new value if the value has changed by deep comparison from one call to the next. This is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. The hook uses the `useRef` and `usePrevious` hooks to store the previous value and compare it to the current value.\n\nThe `useGatedValue` hook takes a value and an update function and returns a gated value. The gated value is only updated if the value has changed and the update function returns true. This is useful for filtering out unwanted updates and optimizing performance. The hook uses the `useRef` hook to store the current value and compare it to the new value.\n\nThe `useWhenOnScreenAfterNewValueDebounced` hook takes a value and a debounce time and returns a ref and a boolean. The hook returns true when the ref becomes on screen for the first time after some time period and stays true until the value changes. This is useful for scrolling loading. The hook uses the `useInView`, `usePrevious`, and `useState` hooks to track the state of the component and update it when necessary.\n\nOverall, these hooks provide additional functionality to the `weave` project by optimizing performance, tracking state changes, and providing additional functionality for scrolling loading.

These components work together to ensure a consistent and efficient user experience throughout the project.\n\nFor instance, the `index.css` file sets up global CSS variables and basic styles for the entire page, making it easier to maintain a consistent visual style. An example usage of the global CSS variables is:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  background-color: var(--primaryColor);\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px 20px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n```\n\nThe `assets` subfolder provides a custom font and various icon classes, as well as a spinner animation, that can be used throughout the project to enhance the user interface and improve the user experience.

It takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with the keys in `U` required. `Subset` requires only a subset of keys from the given type. It takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with only the keys in `U` required.\n\n`DeepPartial` takes a type `T` and returns a new type that is the same as `T`, but with all properties marked as optional. `PartialSome` takes a type `T` and a union of keys `U` and returns a new type that is `T` with the keys in `U` optional.\n\n`Parameters` takes a function type `F` and returns a tuple of the parameter types of `F`.\n\nFinally, there are two interfaces `Match` and `MatchParams` that define the shape of URL parameters from a Route component.

The `Tag` interface has three properties: `name`, `colorIndex`, and `icon`. \n\nThe `name` property is a string that represents the name of the tag. This is the only required property for a tag object. The `colorIndex` property is an optional number that represents the color of the tag. This property is used to assign a color to the tag, which can help visually distinguish it from other tags. The `icon` property is also optional and represents an icon that can be associated with the tag. This property is used to provide additional visual cues to help identify the tag.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to define the structure of tag objects that are used throughout the application. By defining a consistent interface for tags, the application can ensure that all tags have the required properties and can be used interchangeably. This can help simplify the code and make it easier to work with tags throughout the application.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Tag` interface might be used in the larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Tag } from 'weave';\n\nconst myTag: Tag = {\n  name: 'My Tag',\n  colorIndex: 2,\n  icon: 'tag',\n};\n\nconsole.log(myTag.name); // Output: 'My Tag'\nconsole.log(myTag.colorIndex); // Output: 2\nconsole.log(myTag.icon); // Output: 'tag'\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `Tag` interface from the `weave` module. We then create a new tag object called `myTag` that has a name of 'My Tag', a color index of 2, and an icon of 'tag'. We can then access the properties of the `myTag` object using dot notation.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `Tag` interface?** \nThe `Tag` interface defines the structure of an object that represents a tag, which includes a name, an optional color index, and an optional icon from the Semantic UI React library.\n\n2. **What is the `SemanticICONS` import used for?** \nThe `SemanticICONS` import is used to define the type of the `icon` property in the `Tag` interface.

The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to define and manipulate JSON objects in a type-safe manner.\n\nThe `JSONObject` interface represents a JSON object, which is essentially a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings and the values can be of any type, including other JSON objects or arrays. The `Primitive` type represents simple values that can be directly represented in JSON, such as strings, numbers, and booleans. The `Arr` interface represents an array of values, which can also include other JSON objects or arrays. Finally, the `Value` type represents any valid JSON value, which can be a primitive, an object, or an array.\n\nThese interfaces and types can be used throughout the larger project to define and manipulate JSON data. For example, if the project needs to send a JSON payload to an API, it can define the payload as a `JSONObject` and populate it with the necessary key-value pairs. If the project needs to parse a JSON response from an API, it can use these interfaces and types to ensure that the response is properly formatted and type-safe.\n\nHere is an example of how these interfaces and types can be used:\n\n```typescript\n// Define a JSON object with a nested array\nconst myObj: JSONObject = {\n  name: \"John\",\n  age: 30,\n  hobbies: [\"reading\", \"writing\", \"coding\"]\n};\n\n// Access a value in the object\nconst name: string = myObj.name;\n\n// Iterate over the array\nmyObj.hobbies.forEach(hobby => {\n  console.log(hobby);\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, we define a `JSONObject` with a `name` key that maps to a string, an `age` key that maps to a number, and a `hobbies` key that maps to an array of strings. We can access the `name` value using dot notation, and we can iterate over the `hobbies` array using a `forEach` loop. By using these interfaces and types, we can ensure that our JSON data is properly formatted and type-safe throughout our project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This type represents the schema for the notebook format used in the project. The Cell type is also exported, which represents a single cell in the notebook. The DisplayData type represents the output of a cell that is displayed to the user, and the ExecuteResult type represents the output of a cell that is executed.\n\nBy exporting these types, other parts of the project can use them to ensure consistency and compatibility with the nbformat schema. For example, if a new feature is added to the nbformat schema in a future version, this file can be updated to include the new type and export it for use in other parts of the project.\n\nHere is an example of how these exported types could be used in another file in the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Cell, DisplayData } from 'weave';\n\nfunction displayCellOutput(cell: Cell) {\n  if (cell.cell_type === 'code' && cell.outputs) {\n    cell.outputs.forEach(output => {\n      if (output.output_type === 'display_data') {\n        const displayData = output as DisplayData;\n        // do something with the display data\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the Cell and DisplayData types are imported from the weave module and used to type check the input to the displayCellOutput function.

The input string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the `description` property. The remaining lines are joined together to form the `schema` property. If the input string is null or empty, both properties are set to undefined.\n\nThe `createArtifactTypeDescription` function takes a `description` string and an optional `schema` string as input and returns a string. The `description` string is split into lines, and the first line is used as the first line of the output string. If the `schema` string is not null, it is appended to the output string with a newline character.\n\nThe `parseArtifactLabels` function takes a string as input and returns an object of type `ArtifactLabels`. The input string is expected to be a JSON-encoded string. If the input string is not valid JSON, an empty object is returned.\n\nThe `parseLabelString` function takes a string of the form \"key:value\" as input and returns an object of type `Label`. If the input string is not in the expected format, the `key` and `val` properties of the returned object are set to empty strings.\n\nThe `newLabelValid` function takes a `Label` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `key` property has a length greater than 2 and the `val` property is not empty.\n\nThe `newAliasValid` function takes a string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is not empty.\n\nThe `artifactNiceName` function takes an artifact object and an optional options object as input and returns a string. The output string is of the form \"artifactSequence.name:digest\" or \"artifactSequence.name:commitHash\" if `versionIndex` is null. If `versionIndex` is not null, the output string is of the form \"artifactSequence.name:vversionIndex\". If `shortenDigest` is true, the `digest` property is shortened to the first 6 characters.\n\nThe `artifactMembershipNiceName` function takes a `collectionName` string and an identifier object as input and returns a string of the form \"collectionName:alias\". The `alias` property is determined based on the properties of the input identifier object.\n\nThe `isVersionAlias` function takes an object with an `alias` property as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` property is of the form \"vX\", where X is a positive integer.\n\nThe `getDescriptionSummary` function takes an artifact description string as input and returns the first line of the string.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ArtifactLabels` and `Label` interfaces?\n- The `ArtifactLabels` interface defines a dictionary object where the keys are strings and the values are arrays of strings. The `Label` interface defines an object with `key` and `val` properties, both of which are strings.\n\n2. What do the `parseArtifactTypeDescription` and `createArtifactTypeDescription` functions do?\n- `parseArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a string and returns an object with `description` and `schema` properties. If the input string is null or empty, the function returns default values. `createArtifactTypeDescription` takes in a `description` string and an optional `schema` string, and returns a concatenated string with a newline character between the two.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isVersionAlias` function?\n- The `isVersionAlias` function takes in an object with an `alias` property and returns a boolean indicating whether the `alias` matches a specific regular expression pattern (`/^v(\\d+)$/`).

The first `console.log` statement outputs `75` because the `health` value is already within the specified range. The second `console.log` statement outputs `0` because the `newHealth` value is less than the `minHealth` value, so it is clamped to `minHealth`.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function uses the `Color` class from the `color` library to manipulate colors.\n\nThe `colorNRGB` function is similar to `colorN`, but it returns an RGB array instead of a string. This function can be useful when working with libraries that require RGB values instead of color strings.\n\nThe `ROBIN16` constant is an array of 16 colors in a specific order. This order is used in other parts of the project, so it is defined as a constant to ensure consistency.\n\nThe `GLOBAL_COLORS` constant is an object that defines several colors used throughout the project.

The module exports three matchers: `FuzzyMatcher`, `ExactMatcher`, and `RegexMatcher`. Each matcher has two methods: `match` and `highlight`. The `match` method takes an array of objects, a string to match against, and a function that returns a string from each object. It returns an array of objects that match the given string, sorted in natural order. The `highlight` method takes a string, a query string to match against, and a style object to apply to the matched text. It returns a React fragment with the matched text wrapped in a span with the given style.\n\nThe `FuzzyMatcher` uses the `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` and `fuzzyMatchHighlight` functions from the `fuzzyMatch` module to perform fuzzy matching and highlighting. The `ExactMatcher` uses the `indexOf` method to find exact matches and sorts the results using `localeCompare`. The `RegexMatcher` uses a regular expression to match against the string and sorts the results using `localeCompare`.\n\nThe module also exports two functions: `dynamicMatchWithMapping` and `dynamicMatchHighlight`. These functions take a matching mode (`fuzzy`, `exact`, or `regex`), an array of objects, a string to match against, and a function that returns a string from each object. The `dynamicMatchWithMapping` function returns an array of objects that match the given string using the specified matching mode. The `dynamicMatchHighlight` function returns a React fragment with the matched text highlighted using the specified matching mode and style.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `dynamicMatchWithMapping` and `dynamicMatchHighlight` functions:\n\n```jsx\nimport { dynamicMatchWithMapping, dynamicMatchHighlight } from 'weave/matchers';\n\nconst items = [\n  { name: 'apple', category: 'fruit' },\n  { name: 'banana', category: 'fruit' },\n  { name: 'carrot', category: 'vegetable' },\n  { name: 'orange', category: 'fruit' },\n];\n\nconst mode = 'fuzzy';\nconst query = 'app';\nconst strFunc = (item) => item.name;\n\nconst matchedItems = dynamicMatchWithMapping(mode, items, query, strFunc);\n\nconst highlightedText = dynamicMatchHighlight(mode, 'apple', query, { fontWeight: 'bold' });\n\n// matchedItems: [{ name: 'apple', category: 'fruit' }]\n// highlightedText: <span><span>ap</span>ple</span>\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

When props are passed, their values are preferred over state. This hook takes three arguments: `initialValueIfUncontrolled`, `controlledValue`, and `setControlledValue`. \n\nThe `initialValueIfUncontrolled` argument is the initial value of the state if it is not controlled by props. The `controlledValue` argument is the value of the state if it is controlled by props. The `setControlledValue` argument is a callback function that sets the value of the state if it is controlled by props.\n\nThe hook uses the `useState` hook from React to create a state variable called `state` with an initial value of `initialValueIfUncontrolled`. If the `controlledValue` and `setControlledValue` arguments are both defined or both undefined, the hook returns an array with the value of `controlledValue` or `state` (whichever is defined) as the first element and the `setControlledValue` function or the `setState` function (whichever is defined) as the second element. If the `controlledValue` and `setControlledValue` arguments are not both defined or both undefined, the hook throws an error.\n\nThis hook can be used in a larger React project to allow components to have both controlled and uncontrolled state. For example, a component that displays a form input could use this hook to allow the input value to be controlled by a parent component or to have an initial value if it is not controlled. Here is an example usage of this hook:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport useControllableState from './useControllableState';\n\nfunction Input({ value: controlledValue, onChange, defaultValue }) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useControllableState(defaultValue, controlledValue, onChange);\n\n  function handleChange(event) {\n    setValue(event.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Input` component takes three props: `value`, `onChange`, and `defaultValue`. The `value` prop is the controlled value of the input, the `onChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the input value changes, and the `defaultValue` prop is the initial value of the input if it is not controlled. The `useControllableState` hook is used to create a state variable called `value` that is either controlled by the `value` and `onChange` props or uncontrolled with an initial value of `defaultValue`. The `handleChange` function updates the `value` state when the input value changes, and the `value` state is used as the value of the input element.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It returns a tuple containing the current value (either the controlled value or the internal state) and a setter function (either the setControlledValue function or the setState function).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the conditional statement in the hook?\n    \n    The conditional statement checks if the controlledValue and setControlledValue props are both defined or both undefined. If they are not, it throws an error indicating that both props must be passed or neither can be passed.

The module exports several functions that allow for the manipulation of cookies in the browser. \n\nThe `getCookie` function takes a cookie name as an argument and returns the value of the cookie with that name. It does this by first calling the `getCookieStrs` function, which retrieves all the cookies as an array of strings. It then iterates over each string, converting it to a key-value pair using the `cookieStrToKeyVal` function. If the key matches the cookie name, the function returns the value. If no match is found, an empty string is returned.\n\nThe `getCookieBool` function is similar to `getCookie`, but it returns a boolean value indicating whether a cookie with the given name exists or not.\n\nThe `getAllCookies` function returns an object containing all the cookies on the current domain. It does this by iterating over each cookie string, converting it to a key-value pair, and adding it to an object. If a key already exists in the object, the value is converted to an array and the new value is pushed onto it.\n\nThe `setCookie` function sets a cookie with the given key-value pair. It takes an optional `expires` parameter, which is a `Date` object representing the expiration date of the cookie. If no expiration date is provided, the cookie will expire at the end of the session. The `unsetCookie` function removes a cookie with the given key.\n\nThe `getFirebaseCookie` function retrieves a cookie with the given key from Firebase. It does this by calling the `getCookie` function with the key `__session`, which returns a JSON string containing all the Firebase cookies. The function then parses this string and returns the value of the cookie with the given key.\n\nOverall, this module provides a simple interface for working with cookies in the browser.

Each row object has properties corresponding to the column names, and the values can be of any type. The `TableRow` interface is simply a type alias for an object with string keys and any values.\n\nThe `saveTableAsCSV` function takes a `Table` object and calls two other functions to convert the table to CSV format and generate a filename.

The first line is a comma-separated list of the column names, and each subsequent line is a comma-separated list of the values for each row, with values enclosed in double quotes and any double quotes within values escaped by doubling them. \n\nThe `escape` function takes a string and returns a new string with any double quotes replaced by two double quotes, and the entire string enclosed in double quotes. This is used to ensure that values containing commas or double quotes are properly formatted in the CSV output. \n\nThe `saveTextAsCSV` function takes a string of CSV text and a filename, creates a `Blob` object with the text and a MIME type based on the file extension, and triggers a download of the file by creating an `a` element with the URL of the `Blob` and a `download` attribute set to the filename.

The purpose of this file is to provide reusable code that can be used throughout the project. \n\nThe first hook, `useOnMouseDownOutside`, is used to detect when a mouse click occurs outside of a specified set of elements. This hook takes in two parameters: an array of elements and a handler function. When a mouse click occurs outside of the specified elements, the handler function is called. This hook is useful for detecting when a user clicks outside of a dropdown menu or modal, for example. \n\nHere is an example of how `useOnMouseDownOutside` can be used:\n\n```\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const dropdownRef = React.useRef(null);\n\n  const handleMouseDownOutside = (e) => {\n    // close the dropdown if it is open\n  };\n\n  useOnMouseDownOutside([dropdownRef.current], handleMouseDownOutside);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button>Open Dropdown</button>\n      <div ref={dropdownRef}>Dropdown Content</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe second hook, `useOnMouseDownInside`, is similar to `useOnMouseDownOutside`, but it detects when a mouse click occurs inside of a specified element. This hook takes in an element and a handler function. When a mouse click occurs inside of the specified element, the handler function is called. This hook is useful for detecting when a user clicks on a specific element, such as a button or link. \n\nHere is an example of how `useOnMouseDownInside` can be used:\n\n```\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const buttonRef = React.useRef(null);\n\n  const handleMouseDownInside = (e) => {\n    // do something when the button is clicked\n  };\n\n  useOnMouseDownInside(buttonRef.current, handleMouseDownInside);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button ref={buttonRef}>Click Me</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `getLeafNode` function is a utility function that takes in a `Node` and returns the last child node in the tree. This function is useful for finding the last child node in a nested tree structure. \n\nThe `autoScrollWhenDragging` function is a utility function that allows for automatic scrolling when dragging past the page size. This function takes in a `clientY` value and calculates the amount to scroll based on the position of the mouse. This function is useful for implementing drag and drop functionality in a web application. \n\nOverall, this file provides useful utility functions and hooks that can be used throughout the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `useOnMouseDownOutside` and `useOnMouseDownInside` hooks?\n- The `useOnMouseDownOutside` hook alerts when a mousedown event occurs outside of the passed ref, while the `useOnMouseDownInside` hook alerts when a mousedown event occurs inside of the passed ref.\n\n2.

It takes two arguments: `target`, which is the object to be flattened, and `opts`, which is an optional object containing configuration options. \n\nThe function first sets some default values for the configuration options. The `delimiter` option specifies the character to use as a separator between keys in the flattened object. The default is a period (`.`). The `maxDepth` option specifies the maximum depth to which the function should flatten the object. If this option is not provided, the function will flatten the entire object. \n\nThe function then creates an empty object called `output`, which will hold the flattened object. It defines a nested function called `step`, which is used to recursively traverse the object and flatten it. The `step` function takes three arguments: `object`, which is the current object being traversed, `prev`, which is a string representing the keys that have been traversed so far (used to construct the keys in the flattened object), and `currentDepth`, which is the current depth of the traversal (used to check if the maximum depth has been reached).\n\nThe `step` function first iterates over the keys of the current object using `Object.keys`. For each key, it checks the type of the corresponding value using `Object.prototype.toString.call`. If the value is an array, a buffer, or a special object with a `_type` property, it is not flattened. If the value is an object or an array with keys, and the maximum depth has not been reached, the function recursively calls itself with the value as the new `object`, the current key as the new `prev`, and the current depth plus one as the new `currentDepth`. If none of these conditions are met, the function adds the key-value pair to the `output` object.\n\nFinally, the `step` function is called with the `target` object as the initial `object`. The `output` object is returned, which contains the flattened object.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to simplify the processing of nested objects. For example, if the project needs to store data in a database, it may be easier to store a flattened object rather than a nested object. The `flatten` function can be used to convert the nested object to a flattened object before storing it in the database. Similarly, if the project needs to send data over a network, it may be more efficient to send a flattened object rather than a nested object. The `flatten` function can be used to convert the nested object to a flattened object before sending it over the network. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst nestedObject = {\n  foo: {\n    bar: {\n      baz: 42\n    }\n  },\n  qux: [1, 2, 3]\n};\n\nconst flattenedObject = flatten(nestedObject);\n\nconsole.log(flattenedObject);\n// Output: { 'foo.bar.baz': 42, 'qux.0': 1, 'qux.1': 2, 'qux.2': 3 }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `flatten` function?\n- The `flatten` function takes an object and flattens it into a single-level object with keys representing the original nested structure.\n\n2. What are the possible options that can be passed to the `flatten` function?\n- The `flatten` function accepts an optional `opts` object that can contain a `delimiter` string to use as a separator for the flattened keys and a `maxDepth` number to limit the depth of the flattened object.\n\n3. Are there any dependencies required for this code to work?\n- Yes, the code imports the `is-buffer` module, which is used to check if a value is a buffer object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/util/flatten.md"}}],["565",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/util/fullscreen.ts)\n\nThe code above is a function called `onNextExitFullscreen` that is designed to fire a callback when a user exits fullscreen mode. The function takes a single argument, which is a callback function that will be executed when the user exits fullscreen mode. \n\nThe function first creates a wrapped version of the callback function that it receives as an argument. This wrapped function checks whether the document is no longer in fullscreen mode by checking the `document.fullscreen`, `(document as any).mozFullScreenElement`, and `(document as any).msFullscreenElement` properties. If any of these properties are false, it means that the document is no longer in fullscreen mode, and the wrapped function will execute the original callback function with any arguments that were passed to it. \n\nAfter executing the callback function, the wrapped function removes all event listeners that were added to the document. These event listeners were added to detect when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. \n\nFinally, the function adds event listeners to the document for the `webkitfullscreenchange`, `mozfullscreenchange`, `fullscreenchange`, and `MSFullscreenChange` events. These events are triggered when the document enters or exits fullscreen mode. When any of these events are triggered, the wrapped function will be executed, which will check whether the document is no longer in fullscreen mode and execute the original callback function if it is. \n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to provide a way for developers to execute code when a user exits fullscreen mode.

The module exports several functions that can be used to perform fuzzy matching, score matches, and highlight matching substrings. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchRegex` function takes a string and returns a regular expression that matches the string in a fuzzy way. The function iterates over each character in the input string and escapes any special characters before adding a `.*` to match any number of characters between the input characters. The resulting regular expression matches any string that contains all the characters of the input string in the same order. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchScore` function takes two strings and returns a score indicating how well the second string matches the first. The function uses the `longestCommonSubstring` function to find the longest common substring between the two strings and returns its length. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` function takes an array of objects, a search string, and a function that returns a string for each object. The function filters the objects that match the search string using the `fuzzyMatchRegex` function and scores them using the `fuzzyMatchScore` function. The function returns the objects sorted by their score and calls the `preferExactMatch` function to move exact matches to the top of the list. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatch` function is a wrapper around `fuzzyMatchWithMapping` that takes an array of strings instead of objects and returns an array of matching strings. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchSplit` function takes a string and a search string and returns an array of substrings that alternate between matching and non-matching substrings. The function uses a case-insensitive search to find the first occurrence of the search string in the input string and splits the input string into pieces accordingly. \n\nThe `fuzzyComponentSplit` function takes a tuple of two strings and a search string and returns two arrays of substrings that alternate between matching and non-matching substrings. The function concatenates the two input strings and calls `fuzzyMatchSplit` to split the resulting string. The function then splits the resulting array into two arrays based on the length of the substrings that come from the first input string. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchHighlightPieces` function takes an array of substrings and a style object and returns a React fragment that highlights the matching substrings using the style object. The function iterates over the substrings and wraps the matching substrings in a `span` element with the given style. \n\nThe `fuzzyMatchHighlight` function takes a string, a search string, and a style object and returns a React fragment that highlights the earliest matching subsequence in the string using the style object. The function calls `fuzzyMatchSplit` to split the input string and `fuzzyMatchHighlightPieces` to highlight the matching substrings. \n\nThe `preferExactMatch` function takes an array of objects, a search string, and a function that returns a string for each object. The function sorts the objects based on whether their string representation matches the search string exactly and returns the sorted array. \n\nOverall, this module provides a set of functions that can be used to perform fuzzy searching and highlighting in a variety of contexts. The functions can be used to implement search functionality in a web application or to perform fuzzy matching in a data processing pipeline.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It uses the `transform` function from the `lodash` library to recursively compare the two objects and return the differences. This function is not exported and is used internally by other functions in the file.\n\nThe `useTraceUpdate` hook is used for debugging state changes in development. It takes a name and props as arguments and logs the changed props to the console. It uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to keep track of the previous props and compare them to the current props.\n\nThe `useDebouncedEffect` hook is a drop-in replacement for `useEffect` that debounces the effect function across multiple re-renders and dependency changes. It uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to create a debounced function that is called when the dependencies change.\n\nThe `useMap` hook takes a kernel function and an array of inputs and returns an array of outputs. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the output array and avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe `useUnzip` hook takes an array of objects and returns an object with the keys of the input objects and arrays of their values. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the output object and avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe `useIsFirstRender` hook returns a boolean value indicating whether the component is rendering for the first time. It uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to keep track of whether the component has rendered before.\n\nThe `useEffectExceptFirstRender` hook is a version of `useEffect` that does not execute on the first render. It takes an effect function, dependencies, and an optional boolean flag for using `useLayoutEffect`. It uses the `useIsFirstRender` hook to determine whether to execute the effect function.\n\nThe `useSerialAsyncEffect` hook is a version of `useEffect` that runs an async effect and waits for the previous invocation to finish before running the current render's invocation. It takes an async effect function, dependencies, and an optional boolean flag for using `useLayoutEffect`. It uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to keep track of the currently running promise and wait for it to finish before running the next invocation.\n\nThe `useForceRemountOnChange` hook is used to force a component to remount when a dependency changes. It takes an array of dependencies and returns an object with a boolean value indicating whether to render `null` for one cycle. It uses the `useEffectExceptFirstRender` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks to set the `shouldRenderNull` state and reset it after one cycle.\n\nThe `useBooleanState` hook is a utility hook that returns an object with a boolean state value and functions to set the state to true, false, or toggle it. It uses the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks to manage the state and functions.\n\nThe `useSyncedState` hook is a utility hook that synchronizes the state of a component with an external state. It takes an object with the external state and a function to set the external state and returns an object with the component state and a function to set both the component and external state. It uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the component state and synchronize it with the external state.\n\nThe `useStateWithRef` hook is a utility hook that returns an array with the component state, a function to set the state, and a mutable ref object with the current state value. It uses the `useState`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` hooks to manage the state and ref object.\n\nThe `useUpdatingState` hook is a utility hook that returns a tuple with the component state and a function to update the state when the initial value changes.

What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` in the `useEffectExceptFirstRender` function?\n- `useEffectExceptFirstRender` is a custom hook that is a drop-in replacement for `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`, but it does not execute on the first render. It is useful for effects that are only supposed to run when dependencies change. The `layoutEffect` parameter determines whether to use `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useSyncedState` hook?\n- The `useSyncedState` hook is used to keep two states in sync with each other. It takes in a state to sync with and a function to set that state, and returns a state and a function to set that state.

These functions are designed to manipulate HTML strings in various ways.\n\nThe `blankifyLinks` function takes an HTML string as input and returns a modified version of the string where all anchor tags (`<a>`) have a `target=\"_blank\"` attribute added to them. This is useful for security reasons, as it ensures that links opened from the page will not replace the current page, potentially leading to data loss or other issues. Here is an example usage of the `blankifyLinks` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst html = '<a href=\"https://example.com\">Example</a>';\nconst modifiedHtml = blankifyLinks(html);\nconsole.log(modifiedHtml); // '<a href=\"https://example.com\" target=\"_blank\">Example</a>'\n```\n\nThe `shiftHeadings` function is designed to modify the heading tags (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) in an HTML string. Specifically, it shifts all headings down by one level (e.g. `<h1>` becomes `<h2>`, `<h2>` becomes `<h3>`, etc.). This is done to prevent users from adding `<h1>` tags for SEO purposes, which can negatively impact the accessibility of the page. Here is an example usage of the `shiftHeadings` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst html = '<h1>Heading 1</h1><h2>Heading 2</h2>';\nconst modifiedHtml = shiftHeadings(html);\nconsole.log(modifiedHtml); // '<h2>Heading 1</h2><h3>Heading 2</h3>'\n```\n\nThe `escapeHTML` function is used to escape special characters in an HTML string, such as `<`, `>`, and `&`. This is important for security reasons, as it prevents users from injecting malicious code into the page. Here is an example usage of the `escapeHTML` function:\n\n```javascript\nconst html = '<script>alert(\"Hello!\");</script>';\nconst escapedHtml = escapeHTML(html);\nconsole.log(escapedHtml); // '&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;Hello!&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;'\n```\n\nOverall, these functions are useful for ensuring the security and accessibility of HTML content in the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The default length is 9 characters, but this can be overridden by passing a different value as an argument. \n\nThe function uses the `Math.random()` method to generate a random number between 0 and 1. This method is seeded with a unique algorithm, which ensures that the generated number is highly likely to be unique. The function then converts this number to a base-36 string, which includes both numbers and letters. Finally, the function extracts the first `length` characters of this string, starting from the third character (the first two characters are always \"0.\" due to the conversion process).\n\nThis function can be used in a variety of contexts where unique identifiers are needed. For example, it could be used to generate unique IDs for database records, user accounts, or session tokens. The function's flexibility in allowing the length of the ID to be specified makes it useful in situations where different levels of uniqueness are required. \n\nHere is an example of how the `ID` function could be used in a Node.js application:\n\n```\nconst weave = require('weave');\n\nconst newRecord = {\n  id: weave.ID(),\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  email: 'johndoe@example.com'\n};\n\n// Save the new record to the database\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ID` function is used to generate a unique ID for a new database record.

What is the purpose of the ID function?\n   - The ID function generates a random alphanumeric string of a specified length (default is 9).\n2. Why is Math.random() converted to base 36 and why are the first 9 characters after the decimal used?\n   - Math.random() is converted to base 36 to include both numbers and letters in the generated string. The first 9 characters after the decimal are used to ensure uniqueness of the generated string.\n3. Are there any potential issues with using Math.random() for generating unique IDs?\n   - Yes, there is a possibility of collisions (i.e. generating the same ID twice) since Math.random() is not truly random and has a finite number of possible values.

It searches the string for URLs and Markdown-style links, and returns an array of strings and JSX elements. Each element in the array represents a portion of the original string or a JSX element containing a link. The original order of the string is preserved. For example, the input string \"See my website at http://mywebsite.com and leave a comment!\" would yield the following output: `['See my website at ', <a href.../>, ' and leave a comment!']`. The `linkify` function can be used to automatically convert URLs and Markdown-style links in text to clickable links.\n\nThe `TargetBlank` component is a memoized version of an anchor tag that opens links in a new tab. It enforces an absolute prefixed URL for blank targets, and sets the `target` and `rel` attributes of the anchor tag to `_blank`, `noopener`, and `noreferrer`, respectively. The `Link` component is a memoized version of a React Router `Link` component that can be used to create links within the application. It takes an optional `RRLinkComp` prop that can be used to specify a different component to use for the link. If the `to` prop of the `Link` component is a string that starts with `http` or `//`, the link is treated as an external link and opened in a new tab by default. The `NavLink` component is a memoized version of a React Router `NavLink` component that can be used to create links with active styling.\n\nThe `LinkNoCrawl` component is a memoized version of an anchor tag that prevents search engines from following the link until the user interacts with it. It takes an optional `LinkComp` prop that can be used to specify a different component to use for the link. The component uses the `useState` and `useCallback` hooks to keep track of whether the user has interacted with the link. If the user has not interacted with the link, the component returns an anchor tag with the same properties as the original component. If the user has interacted with the link, the component returns the specified `LinkComp` component with the same properties as the original component.\n\nThe `getHREFFromAbsoluteURL` function takes an absolute URL and returns the URL with the `https` protocol added if it is not already present.

This can help to visually differentiate between different segments and make the data easier to read and understand.\n\nHere is an example of how the `boxColor` function could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { boxColor } from 'weave';\n\nconst Box = ({ id, content }) => {\n  const color = boxColor(id);\n\n  return (\n    <div style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>\n      {content}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Box` component takes in an `id` and `content` prop. The `boxColor` function is called with the `id` prop to generate a unique color for the box. The color is then used as the background color for the `div` element that displays the box content.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `colorN` and `ROBIN16` imports from `./colors`?\n   - The `colorN` and `ROBIN16` imports are used to determine the color of a box based on its `id`.\n2. Why is the `boxColor` function a separate wrapper function instead of being integrated into the code that calls it?\n   - The `boxColor` function is a separate wrapper function to allow for future flexibility in case the segmentation colors need to be changed or updated.\n3. Are there any other functions or variables in this file that are not being used?\n   - No, there are no other functions or variables in this file that are not being used.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/util/media.md"}}],["573",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/util/netron.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports an array of file extensions called `EXTENSIONS` and a function called `isViewable`. The purpose of this code is to register file extensions that can be viewed in the `weave` project and to check if a given file is viewable based on its extension.\n\nThe `register` function takes in two arguments: `id` and `extensions`. `id` is a string that represents the path to a module that can handle the given file extensions. `extensions` is an array of strings that represent file extensions. The function loops through each extension in the array and pushes it to the `EXTENSIONS` array.\n\nThe `isViewable` function takes in a string argument called `fname` which represents the name of a file. The function extracts the file extension from the `fname` argument and checks if it is included in the `EXTENSIONS` array using the `_.includes` method from the `lodash` library. If the extension is included in the array, the function returns `true`, indicating that the file is viewable. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThis code is used in the larger `weave` project to determine which files can be viewed in the application. For example, if a user uploads a file with a `.h5` extension, the `isViewable` function will return `true` because `.h5` is included in the `EXTENSIONS` array. This will allow the user to view the contents of the file in the `weave` application.\n\nCode example:\n\n```\nimport { isViewable } from 'weave';\n\nconst fileName = 'example.h5';\nconst isFileViewable = isViewable(fileName);\n\nif (isFileViewable) {\n  // display file contents in weave application\n} else {\n  // file is not viewable in weave application\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It exports several functions and a class that can be used to create and manage instances of the NGL.Stage class, which is used to render 3D molecular structures.\n\nThe `getStage` function creates a global instance of the NGL.Stage class and returns it. It takes an object with `width` and `height` properties as an argument, which it uses to set the size of the stage element. If the global instance has not been created yet, it creates it with a white background color and no tooltip. It then sets the size of the stage to the specified width and height and returns it.\n\nThe `moleculeStage` function creates a new instance of the NGL.Stage class and returns it. It takes several arguments: a DOM element to attach the stage to, a path to a file or blob containing the molecular structure data, an object with `width` and `height` properties to set the size of the stage, an object with an optional `representation` property to specify the type of representation to use for the structure, and a string specifying the file extension of the structure data. It sets the size of the DOM element to the specified width and height, creates a new instance of the NGL.Stage class with the DOM element, sets the size of the stage to the specified width and height, loads the structure data from the specified path, adds the specified representation to the structure or the default representation if none is specified, centers the view on the structure, and rotates the structure to align with its principal axes.\n\nThe `StageManager` class is used to manage instances of the NGL.Stage class. It has a `requestStage` method that takes a DOM element as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to a new instance of the NGL.Stage class. If there are fewer than the maximum number of active stages, it creates a new stage and resolves the promise with it. Otherwise, it adds the promise and the DOM element to a queue and waits for a stage to become available. When a stage is disposed of, it checks the queue and resolves the next promise with a new stage if there are any waiting.\n\nThe `moleculeScreenshot` function is similar to the `moleculeStage` function, but it returns a promise that resolves to a screenshot of the rendered structure as a blob. It takes the same arguments as `moleculeStage` and creates a new DOM element to attach the stage to. It then requests a new stage from the `StageManager` and loads the structure data into it. It adds the specified representation to the structure or the default representation if none is specified, centers the view on the structure, and rotates the structure to align with its principal axes. It then creates an image of the stage and disposes of it, returning the image as a blob.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to create and manage instances of the NGL.Stage class for rendering 3D molecular structures. It also provides a way to create screenshots of the rendered structures. The `StageManager` class ensures that the maximum number of active stages is not exceeded, which can help prevent performance issues when rendering many structures at once.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This function is useful when filtering arrays to remove null or undefined values. For example, `['a', null, 'b'].filter(notEmpty)` would return `['a', 'b']`.\n\nThe `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function recursively maps over an object or array and applies a given function to each value. If the input is an array, the function maps over each item and recursively calls itself on each item. If the input is an object, the function maps over each value and recursively calls itself on each value. The function returns a new object or array with the mapped values. This function can be useful for transforming data structures. For example, `deepMapValuesAndArrays({a: [1, 2], b: {c: 3}}, v => v * 2)` would return `{a: [2, 4], b: {c: 6}}`.\n\nThe `shallowEqual` function checks if two objects are equal by comparing their keys and values. If the objects have different keys or values, the function returns false. This function can be useful for checking if two objects have changed. For example, `shallowEqual({a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 1, b: 2})` would return `true`, while `shallowEqual({a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 1, b: 3})` would return `false`.\n\nThe `zip` function takes any number of arrays and returns an array of objects where each key is the index of the input arrays and each value is the corresponding value at that index. This function can be useful for combining data from multiple arrays. For example, `zip([1, 2], ['a', 'b'])` would return `[{0: 1, 1: 'a'}, {0: 2, 1: 'b'}]`.\n\nOverall, these utility functions can be used to manipulate and transform data structures in the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `zip` function and how does it work?\n   - The `zip` function takes in an array of arrays and returns a new array of objects where each object has properties corresponding to the elements at the same index in each array. The `DeArray` type is used to extract the element type of an array, and the `Pivot` type is used to create an array of objects with properties based on the input arrays.

The `x` and `y` parameters are both of type `number`.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to compare two numbers (`x` and `y`) based on the comparison operator (`op`) provided. If the comparison operator is `'gte'` (greater than or equal to), the function returns `true` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If the comparison operator is `'lte'` (less than or equal to), the function returns `true` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If the comparison operator is neither `'gte'` nor `'lte'`, the function returns `false`.\n\nThis function can be used in various parts of the larger project to compare numbers based on different comparison operators. For example, if the project involves sorting a list of numbers in ascending or descending order, this function can be used to compare the numbers and determine their relative positions in the sorted list.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `compare` function:\n\n```\nconst result1 = compare('gte', 5, 3); // returns true\nconst result2 = compare('lte', 5, 3); // returns false\nconst result3 = compare('invalid', 5, 3); // returns false\n``` \n\nIn the example above, `result1` is `true` because `5` is greater than or equal to `3`. `result2` is `false` because `5` is not less than or equal to `3`. `result3` is also `false` because `'invalid'` is not a valid comparison operator.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \nThis code exports a type `CompareOp` and a function `compare` that takes in two numbers and a comparison operator and returns a boolean value based on the comparison.\n\n2. **What are the possible values for the `CompareOp` type?** \nThe `CompareOp` type can have two possible values: `'gte'` or `'lte'`.\n\n3. **What happens if an invalid comparison operator is passed to the `compare` function?** \nIf an invalid comparison operator is passed to the `compare` function, the function will default to the `else` block and return `x <= y`.

These properties can be used to pass additional styling or identification information to child components. \n\nThe function, called pickNameProps, takes in a generic type of props and returns an object that only includes the className and id properties from the original props object. This function uses the popular JavaScript library Lodash to pick out the desired properties.

These functions are used to create helper functions that determine whether a React component should update based on changes to its props or state.\n\nThe `makeShouldUpdate` function takes a `spec` object as an argument, which contains various options for how to compare props. The function returns a `checker` function that takes three arguments: `props`, `nextProps`, and `extra`. The `props` and `nextProps` arguments are objects containing the current and next props, respectively. The `extra` argument is an optional string that can be used to provide additional information about the component being checked.\n\nThe `checker` function iterates over the keys of `nextProps` and compares each key to the corresponding key in `props`. If the key is in the `ignoreFunctions` or `ignoreJSX` arrays in the `spec` object, or if it is in the `ignore` array, the comparison is skipped. If the key is in the `deep` array, a deep comparison is performed using `_.isEqualWith`. Otherwise, a shallow comparison is performed using `===`. The results of the comparisons are stored in a `result` object, which is used to determine whether the component should update.\n\nIf the `debug` option is set to `true` in the `spec` object and the `shouldUpdate` variable is `true`, the function logs information about the props that have changed. If the `verbose` option is also set to `true`, the function logs additional information about the props that have changed, including the before and after values and any differences between them.\n\nThe `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` function is similar to `makeShouldUpdate`, but it compares both props and state. The `spec` object is the same as in `makeShouldUpdate`, but the `deep` key is only used for props. The function returns a `checker` function that takes three arguments: `props`, `state`, and `extra`. The `props` and `state` arguments are arrays of things to compare, like `[this.props, nextProps]` and `[this.state, nextState]`, respectively.\n\nThe `makePropsAreEqual` function takes a `spec` object as an argument and returns a function that compares two sets of props and returns `true` if they are equal. The function uses `makeShouldUpdate` to create a `didPropsUpdate` function, which it then uses to compare the props.\n\nThese functions can be used in a React component's `shouldComponentUpdate` method to determine whether the component should update based on changes to its props or state. For example:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {makeDidPropsOrStateChange} from 'weave';\n\nconst mySpec = {\n  name: 'MyComponent',\n  deep: ['foo', 'bar'],\n  ignore: ['baz'],\n  ignoreFunctions: true,\n  ignoreJSX: true,\n  debug: true,\n  verbose: true,\n};\n\nconst didPropsOrStateChange = makeDidPropsOrStateChange(mySpec);\n\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {\n    return didPropsOrStateChange([this.props, nextProps], [this.state, nextState], 'MyComponent');\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `makeShouldUpdate` function?\n- The `makeShouldUpdate` function is a helper function that checks if a component's props have changed and returns a boolean value indicating whether the component should update or not.\n\n2. What is the difference between `makeShouldUpdate` and `makeDidPropsOrStateChange`?\n- `makeShouldUpdate` only compares props, while `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` compares both props and state. `makeDidPropsOrStateChange` uses `makeShouldUpdate` internally to compare props.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `makePropsAreEqual` function?\n- The `makePropsAreEqual` function returns a function that can be used as the `arePropsEqual` argument in `React.memo()`. This function checks if the props of two components are equal and returns a boolean value indicating whether the components should be re-rendered or not.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/util/shouldUpdate.md"}}],["584",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/common/util/string.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a file with various utility functions for string manipulation.

If the delimiter is not present in the string, the function returns an array with the original string and a null value. For example:\n\n```\nsplitOnce('hello-world', '-') // returns ['hello', 'world']\nsplitOnce('hello', '-') // returns ['hello', null]\n```\n\nThe `splitOnceLast` function is similar to `splitOnce`, but it returns the substring before the last occurrence of the delimiter and the substring after the last occurrence of the delimiter. If the delimiter is not present in the string, the function returns an array with two null values. For example:\n\n```\nsplitOnceLast('hello-world', '-') // returns ['hello', 'world']\nsplitOnceLast('hello-world-hi', '-') // returns ['hello-world', 'hi']\nsplitOnceLast('hello', '-') // returns [null, null]\n```\n\nThe `stripQuotesAndSpace` function takes in a string and removes any leading or trailing quotes or whitespace. If the input is not a string, the function returns the input unchanged.\n\nThe `sanitizeGQLAlias` function takes in a string and replaces any non-letter, non-number, or non-underscore characters with double underscores. This function is useful for ensuring that a string can be used as a valid GraphQL alias.\n\nThe `capitalizeFirst` function takes in a string and capitalizes the first letter while making the rest of the string lowercase.\n\nThe `isValidEmail` function takes in a string and returns true if the string matches the pattern of a valid email address.\n\nThe `removeNonASCII` function takes in a string and removes any non-ASCII characters.\n\nThe `indent` function takes in a string and a number representing the indentation level and returns the string with the specified number of spaces added to the beginning of each line.\n\nThe `applyPrefixIfNeeded` function takes in a prefix and a string and returns the string with the prefix added if it is not already present.\n\nThe `stripPrefixesIfNeeded` function takes in an array of prefixes and a string and returns the string with any of the specified prefixes removed from the beginning.\n\nThe `replaceDashWithSpace` function takes in a string and replaces any dashes with spaces.\n\nOverall, these utility functions provide a convenient way to perform common string operations throughout the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This function is designed to improve the user experience for creating new tags by providing immediate feedback to the user if they enter an invalid character.\n\nThe function takes a single parameter, `tag`, which is a string representing the user input for the tag. The function then creates a regular expression, `reValidString`, which matches any string that contains only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, spaces, and colons.

This can be useful when dealing with optional values in TypeScript. For example, a function that takes an optional string parameter could be defined as `function foo(str?: Nullable<string>)`.\n\nThe `ValueOf` type is a utility type that returns the union of all the values in an object. This can be useful when working with enums or other objects where you want to get a union of all the possible values. For example, if you have an enum `enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }`, you can get a union of all the values with `type AllColors = ValueOf<typeof Color>`.\n\nThe `Struct` type is a generic type that defines a record with string keys and values of a certain type. This can be useful when defining objects with a fixed set of keys and types. For example, you could define a type for a user object with `type User = Struct<{ name: string, age: number }>`. \n\nThe `SetState` type is a type alias for the `Dispatch` function from React's `useState` hook. This can be useful when you want to define a type for a state updater function. For example, if you have a state variable `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`, you can define a type for the `setCount` function with `type SetCount = SetState<number>`.\n\nThe `FCWithRef` type is a type alias for a React functional component that accepts a ref. This can be useful when defining components that need to forward refs to child components. For example, you could define a component that forwards a ref to a button element with `const Button = forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {...})`.\n\nThe `isNotNullOrUndefined`, `isNotNullUndefinedOrFalse`, and `isTruthy` functions are type guards that can be used to narrow down the type of a value. These functions return a boolean that indicates whether the value is not null/undefined, not null/undefined/false, or truthy, respectively. These can be useful when working with optional values or when you want to ensure that a value is not falsy before using it.\n\nThe `assertUnreachable` function is a utility function that throws an error if it is ever called. This can be useful when you have a switch statement or other code that should never be reached, but TypeScript cannot infer that the code is unreachable.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The string should have the format `${refName:rest:dflt}`, where `refName` is either `'field'` or `'string'`, `rest` is the name of the field or string, and `dflt` is an optional default value for string references. \n\nThe `extractRefs` function takes a string and returns an array of `FieldRef` objects representing all valid references in the string. The function uses a regular expression to match all substrings of the form `${refName:rest:dflt}` and passes each substring to the `toRef` function. \n\nThe `fieldInjectResult` function takes a `FieldRef` object and a `UserSettings` object and returns a string representing the injected value for the field reference. If the `FieldRef` object has a type of `'field'`, the function looks up the field name in the `fieldSettings` property of the `UserSettings` object and returns the value, replacing all periods with backslashes. If the `FieldRef` object has a type of `'string'`, the function looks up the string name in the `stringSettings` property of the `UserSettings` object and returns the value, or the default value if no value is found. \n\nThe `parseSpecFields` function takes a visualization specification object and returns an array of `FieldRef` objects representing all valid references in the specification. The function uses the `flatten` function from the `./flatten` module to flatten the specification object into an array of values, filters the array to include only string values, maps each string value to an array of `FieldRef` objects using the `extractRefs` function, and flattens the resulting array of arrays into a single array using `_.flatMap`. The function then removes any duplicate `FieldRef` objects using `_.uniqWith`. \n\nThe `makeInjectMap` function takes an array of `FieldRef` objects and a `UserSettings` object and returns an array of objects with `from` and `to` properties representing the mapping between reference strings and injected values. The function iterates over the `FieldRef` objects and calls the `fieldInjectResult` function for each object, adding an object with `from` and `to` properties to the result array if the injected value is not `null`. \n\nThe `injectFields` function takes a visualization specification object, an array of `FieldRef` objects, and a `UserSettings` object and returns a new visualization specification object with all valid references in the specification replaced with their injected values. The function uses the `makeInjectMap` function to create a mapping between reference strings and injected values, and then uses the `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function from the `./obj` module to recursively replace all reference strings in the specification object with their injected values. \n\nThe `hasInput` function takes an object and returns `true` if the object contains a key of `'input'` or any nested object contains a key of `'input'`, or `false` otherwise. \n\nThe `specHasBindings` function takes a visualization specification object and returns `true` if the specification object contains any bindings, or `false` otherwise. The function checks the `$schema` property of the specification object to determine the type of specification, and then checks the appropriate property (`params` for Vega-Lite v5, `selection` for Vega-Lite, or `signals` for Vega) for any bindings using the `hasInput` function.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the `updateQueryIndex` function doing?\n- The `updateQueryIndex` function takes in a `Query` object and an `index` number, and returns a new `Query` object with the `index` value added to the `index` argument of the `historyTable` field in the `runSets` query field.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `specHasBindings` function?\n- The `specHasBindings` function takes in a `VisualizationSpec` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the spec has any bindings (i.e. signals or parameters with `bind` properties) that require user input.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/common/util/vega3.md"}}],["593",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/compare.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a TypeScript function called `compare` that takes in three parameters: `op`, `x`, and `y`. The `op` parameter is of type `CompareOp`, which is a union type that can only be either `'gte'` or `'lte'`. The `x` and `y` parameters are both of type `number`. \n\nThe purpose of this function is to compare two numbers (`x` and `y`) based on the comparison operator (`op`) provided. If `op` is `'gte'`, the function will return `true` if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `false` otherwise. If `op` is `'lte'`, the function will return `true` if `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `false` otherwise. \n\nThis function can be used in various parts of the larger project to compare numbers based on different comparison operators. For example, if the project involves sorting a list of numbers in ascending order, the `compare` function can be used to compare two numbers and determine which one should come first in the sorted list. \n\nHere's an example usage of the `compare` function:\n\n```\nconst result1 = compare('gte', 5, 3); // returns true\nconst result2 = compare('lte', 10, 8); // returns false\n``` \n\nIn the first example, `result1` will be `true` because `5` is greater than or equal to `3`. In the second example, `result2` will be `false` because `10` is not less than or equal to `8`. \n\nOverall, the `compare` function provides a simple and reusable way to compare numbers based on different operators, which can be useful in various parts of the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \nThis code exports a type `CompareOp` and a function `compare` that takes in two numbers and a comparison operator and returns a boolean value based on the comparison.\n\n2. **What are the possible values for the `CompareOp` type?** \nThe `CompareOp` type can have two possible values: `'gte'` or `'lte'`.\n\n3. **What happens if an invalid comparison operator is passed to the `compare` function?** \nIf an invalid comparison operator is passed to the `compare` function, the function will default to the `else` block and return `x <= y`.

It then calculates the range of scores for each box and renders a `BoxConfidenceControl` component for each score range, which allows the user to adjust the slider for that score range. \n\nThe `ClassToggles` component takes in a type (either \"mask\" or \"box\"), a filter string, an object of class states, a class set, and a function to update the control. It then filters the class states based on the filter string and renders a `ClassToggle` or `ClassToggleWithSlider` component for each class that matches the filter. \n\nThe `TileLayoutButtons` component takes in a tile layout type, a function to set the layout type, and a mask count. It then renders three buttons for each possible layout type and a `HelpPopup` component with information about the layout types. \n\nThe `ControlsImageOverlays` component takes in an object of bounding boxes, an object of controls, an object of class sets, and a function to update the controls. It then renders a `BoxSliderControls` component if there are bounding boxes, a `TileLayoutButtons` component if there are masks, and a `ClassToggles` component for each control in the controls object. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of reusable React components for controlling image overlays in the `weave` project. These components can be used to adjust the visibility, opacity, and layout of masks and bounding boxes on an image.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What are the different types of controls that can be used with `ControlsImageOverlays`?\n- The different types of controls that can be used with `ControlsImageOverlays` are `box` and `mask`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BoxSliderControls` component and how does it work?\n- The `BoxSliderControls` component is used to display and control sliders for adjusting the confidence of bounding boxes. It works by calculating the range of confidence values for each box and displaying a slider for each confidence value. The user can adjust the slider to change the confidence value and the component will update the state accordingly.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlImageOverlays.md"}}],["613",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlImageOverlays.styles.ts)\n\nThis code defines a set of styled components that can be used in a larger project called \"weave\". The purpose of these components is to provide consistent styling and layout across different parts of the project.\n\nThe `styled-components` library is used to define these components. Each component is defined as a JavaScript function that returns a styled version of a standard HTML element (e.g. `div`, `a`). The styles are defined using CSS-like syntax within a template literal.\n\nFor example, the `AllClassToggle` component is defined as a styled `a` element with a font size of 13 pixels. This component could be used to create a link that toggles the visibility of all classes in a list.\n\nSimilarly, the `Wrapper` component is defined as a styled `div` element with a margin of 24 pixels on the top and bottom. This component could be used to wrap other components and provide consistent spacing between them.\n\nOther components define more complex layouts, such as the `Header` component which is a styled `div` element that contains other components and has a flexible layout. The `ActionsWrapper` component is a styled `div` element that contains other components and has a gap of 16 pixels between them.\n\nOverall, these components provide a way to create consistent and reusable UI elements in the larger \"weave\" project. By using these components, developers can save time and ensure that the project has a consistent look and feel.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code provides styled components for various wrappers and toggles used in the `weave` project, but more information is needed to understand the overall purpose of the project.\n\n2. What is the difference between `AllClassToggle` and `LabelToggleWrapper`?\n- `AllClassToggle` is an anchor element with a font size of 13px, while `LabelToggleWrapper` is a div element with a font size of 14px and additional styling for alignment and width.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `position: absolute` property in `VisibilityToggleWrapper`?\n- This property positions the element absolutely relative to its closest positioned ancestor, which in this case is the `Header` component. The `top` and `left` properties further specify the exact position of the element within the `Header`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlImageOverlays.styles.md"}}],["614",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlMask.tsx)\n\nThe `ControlsMask` component in the `weave` project is responsible for rendering a control that toggles the visibility of an image overlay in a larger image display. The component takes in several props, including the current state of the mask control, a function to update the mask control state, the current state of the image overlay controls, and a function to update the image overlay controls. \n\nThe component first extracts the `tileLayout` property from the `controls` prop, which determines the layout of the image display. If the layout is set to `ALL_SPLIT`, the component updates the `hideImage` property of the `mask` control state when the toggle button is clicked. Otherwise, it updates the `hideImage` property of the `controls` state. The `defaultHideImageState` function is used to determine the default value of `hideImage` based on the `tileLayout` property.\n\nThe `toggleImageVisibility` function is called when the toggle button is clicked. It first determines whether the layout is set to `ALL_SPLIT` and updates the `hideImage` property of the `mask` control state accordingly. Otherwise, it updates the `hideImage` property of the `controls` state. The `updateMask` and `updateControls` functions are used to update the respective control states with the new `hideImage` value.\n\nFinally, the component renders a `WBIcon` component from the `@wandb/ui` library, which displays an icon for toggling the image overlay visibility. The color of the icon is set to grey if the image is currently hidden and black otherwise. When the icon is clicked, the `toggleImageVisibility` function is called to update the control state and re-render the component.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger image display component to allow users to toggle the visibility of image overlays. For example, in a medical imaging application, the image overlay could represent a segmentation mask that highlights certain regions of the image. The `ControlsMask` component would allow users to toggle the visibility of the mask to better visualize the underlying image. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { ControlsMask } from 'weave';\n\nfunction ImageDisplay({ mask, updateMask, controls, updateControls }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <img src=\"path/to/image\" alt=\"image\" />\n      <ControlsMask mask={mask} updateMask={updateMask} controls={controls} updateControls={updateControls} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ControlsMask` component?\n- The `ControlsMask` component is used to render a control for toggling the visibility of an image overlay.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `tileLayout` variable?\n- The `tileLayout` variable is used to determine whether all image overlays are split or not, which affects how the image visibility toggle works.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `WBIcon` component?\n- The `WBIcon` component is used to render an icon that represents the image visibility toggle control, and its color changes based on whether the image is currently hidden or not.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlMask.md"}}],["615",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ControlPage.tsx)\n\nThe `PageControls` component is a React functional component that renders a control bar for pagination of a table. It takes in four props: `rowsNode`, `pageSize`, `page`, and `setPage`. `rowsNode` is a `Node` object from the `@wandb/weave/core` library that represents the rows of the table. `pageSize` is the number of rows to display per page, `page` is the current page number, and `setPage` is a function to update the current page number.\n\nThe component first calculates the total number of rows in the table using the `opCount` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library. It then calculates the start and end indices of the rows to display based on the current page number and page size. If the end index is greater than the total number of rows, it is set to the total number of rows.\n\nThe component also includes an `useEffect` hook that resets the current page number to 0 if the start index is greater than the total number of rows. This is to prevent the component from displaying an empty table if the current page number is out of bounds.\n\nThe component then renders a control bar with two arrow icons for navigating to the previous and next pages. The current page number and total number of rows are displayed in the center of the control bar. The arrow icons are disabled if the current page is the first or last page.\n\nOverall, this component provides a simple and reusable way to add pagination functionality to a table in a React application. Here is an example usage of the `PageControls` component:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport PageControls from './PageControls';\n\nconst Table = () => {\n  const [page, setPage] = useState(0);\n  const rows = [...]; // array of table rows\n  const pageSize = 10; // display 10 rows per page\n\n  const rowsNode = new Node(rows);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {/* render table rows based on current page and page size */}\n      {rows.slice(page * pageSize, (page + 1) * pageSize).map(row => (\n        <tr key={row.id}>\n          <td>{row.name}</td>\n          <td>{row.age}</td>\n          <td>{row.email}</td>\n        </tr>\n      ))}\n      {/* render pagination control bar */}\n      <PageControls\n        rowsNode={rowsNode}\n        pageSize={pageSize}\n        page={page}\n        setPage={setPage}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes in several props, including the name of the control, the range of the slider, and functions to handle changes to the slider value, the operator used to compare the slider value, and whether the control is disabled. The component renders a checkbox to enable/disable the control, a label for the control name, a dropdown to select the comparison operator, and a slider to adjust the value. \n\nThe `SearchInput` component is a simple input field with a search icon that allows users to search for specific items in the application. It takes in a value and a function to handle changes to the input value. \n\nThe `VisibilityToggle` component is a simple icon that toggles between showing and hiding content. It takes in a boolean value to determine whether the content is currently hidden and a function to handle clicks on the icon. \n\nThe `ClassToggle` component is used to create a button that toggles the visibility of a specific class of items. It takes in the name of the class, a boolean value to determine whether the class is currently disabled, and a color for the button. If the name of the class is \"all\", it renders a `VisibilityToggle` component instead. \n\nThe `LabelToggle` component is similar to the `ClassToggle` component but is used for toggling the visibility of labels. It takes in a boolean value to determine whether the label is currently disabled and a function to handle clicks on the toggle icon. \n\nThe `ControlTitle` component is a styled `span` element used for rendering the title of a control. \n\nThe `ClassToggleWithSlider` component is similar to the `ClassToggle` component but includes a slider control for adjusting the opacity of the class. It takes in the same props as `ClassToggle` as well as a value for the opacity and a function to handle changes to the opacity value. \n\nOverall, these components are used to create a variety of UI controls for the `weave` project.

The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and visually appealing input field that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe `InputWrapper` component is created using the `styled-components` library. It sets the font size to 13 pixels and applies styles to the `.ui.input` class. The `color` property of the `.ui.input` class is set to the `GLOBAL_COLORS.gray` value, which is imported from the `@wandb/weave/common/util/colors` module. This ensures that the text color of the input field is consistent with the rest of the project.\n\nThe `> input` selector applies styles to the input element within the `.ui.input` class. It removes the border and sets the background to transparent, which gives the input field a clean and modern look. The text color is set to `$darkGray`, which is not defined in this code snippet but is likely defined elsewhere in the project. The `::-webkit-input-placeholder` pseudo-element is used to set the placeholder text color to `GLOBAL_COLORS.gray`.\n\nThe `> i.icon` selector applies styles to the icon element within the `.ui.input` class.

It uses the `useSignedUrlWithExpiration` hook to fetch the signed URL for the image and then renders the image, segmentation masks, and bounding boxes using the `SegmentationMaskFromCG` and `BoundingBoxes` components.\n\nThe `SegmentationMaskFromCG` component fetches the segmentation data file URL from CG and renders the segmentation mask using the `SegmentationMaskLoader` component. The `SegmentationCanvas` component is responsible for creating a canvas for visualizing class segmentation. It takes segmentation data, class states, and class overlay states as props and draws the colored segmentation image data on the canvas.\n\nThe `BoundingBoxes` component renders the bounding boxes using the `BoundingBoxesCanvas` component. It takes media size, box data, bounding box controls, slider controls, and class set as props. The `BoundingBoxesCanvas` component draws the bounding boxes on a canvas based on the provided controls and class states.\n\nThe code also includes utility functions for drawing segmentation masks, clearing the canvas, and drawing bounding boxes with labels.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to display images with segmentation masks and bounding boxes, allowing users to visualize and interact with the data.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `CardImage` component and what are its main functionalities?\n   **Answer**: The `CardImage` component is a React functional component that displays an image along with optional masks and bounding boxes. It handles loading the image from a signed URL, rendering the image, and overlaying segmentation masks and bounding boxes if provided.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `SegmentationMaskFromCG` component work and what are its main responsibilities?\n   **Answer**: The `SegmentationMaskFromCG` component is a React functional component that retrieves segmentation data file URL from CG (Connected Graph) and renders a segmentation mask on top of an image. It handles loading the mask file, creating a colored segmentation image data based on class states and overlay states, and rendering the segmentation mask on a canvas.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `BoundingBoxesCanvas` component handle drawing bounding boxes on the canvas and what are the main customization options available?\n   **Answer**: The `BoundingBoxesCanvas` component draws bounding boxes on a canvas by iterating through the provided `boxData` and checking if each box should be hidden based on the `bboxControls` and optional `sliderControls`. It then calculates the box's position and dimensions, sets the line style and color, and draws the box and its label on the canvas. Customization options include line style (solid, dotted, or dashed), hiding labels, and specifying class states for different colors.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/ImageWithOverlays.md"}}],["624",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/KeyValTable.tsx)\n\nThe code above defines several styled components that can be used to create tables and input update links in a web application. The purpose of this code is to provide a set of reusable components that can be used throughout the larger project to maintain consistency in the styling of tables and input update links.\n\nThe `Table` component is a styled `table` element that can be used to create tables with a consistent style. The `Row` component is a styled `tr` element that can be used to create rows within the table. The `Key` component is a styled `td` element that is used to display the key or label for a value in the table. It has a fixed width of 100 pixels and a gray color defined in the `globals.styles` module. The `Val` component is a styled `td` element that is used to display the value in the table. It has no padding defined.\n\nThe `InputUpdateLink` component is a styled `div` element that can be used to create a link that allows the user to update an input field. It has an underline and dotted text decoration, and a cursor that changes to a pointer when hovered over.\n\nThese components can be imported and used in other parts of the project to create tables and input update links with a consistent style. For example, the `Table`, `Row`, `Key`, and `Val` components could be used to create a table that displays data from an API call. The `InputUpdateLink` component could be used to create a link that allows the user to edit a field in the table.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Table, Row, Key, Val, InputUpdateLink } from 'weave';\n\nconst data = [\n  { key: 'Name', value: 'John Doe' },\n  { key: 'Email', value: 'johndoe@example.com' },\n  { key: 'Phone', value: '555-555-5555' },\n];\n\nconst MyTable = () => {\n  return (\n    <Table>\n      {data.map((item) => (\n        <Row key={item.key}>\n          <Key>{item.key}</Key>\n          <Val>{item.value}</Val>\n        </Row>\n      ))}\n      <Row>\n        <Key>Address</Key>\n        <Val>\n          123 Main St.\n          <InputUpdateLink>Edit</InputUpdateLink>\n        </Val>\n      </Row>\n    </Table>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `globals` import?\n- The `globals` import is used to access the `gray500` color variable in the `Key` styled component.\n\n2. Why are the `padding` styles set to `0 !important` in the `Key` and `Val` styled components?\n- The `padding` styles are set to `0 !important` to override any default padding that may be applied by the browser or other styles.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `InputUpdateLink` styled component?\n- The `InputUpdateLink` styled component is used to create a clickable link with an underline and dotted text decoration.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/KeyValTable.md"}}],["625",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/LayoutSections.tsx)\n\nThe code defines a React functional component called `LayoutSections`. This component takes in two props: `sectionNames` and `renderPanel`. `sectionNames` is an array of strings that represent the names of different sections in a layout. `renderPanel` is a function that takes in an object with an `id` property and returns a React node. \n\nThe purpose of this component is to render a layout with multiple sections, where each section has a name and a panel. The `sectionNames` prop is used to iterate over each section and render its corresponding panel using the `renderPanel` function. The `renderPanel` function is called with an object that has an `id` property set to the name of the current section. This allows the function to render the correct panel for each section.\n\nThe component returns a fragment that contains a div for each section. Each section div contains two child divs: one for the section name and one for the panel. The section name div has a gray background color and some padding, while the panel div has a fixed height of 400 pixels and takes up the full width of its parent container.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to create a layout with multiple sections, where each section has its own panel. The `sectionNames` prop can be used to specify the names of each section, while the `renderPanel` prop can be used to define the content of each panel. Here's an example of how this component can be used:\n\n```\n<LayoutSections\n  sectionNames={['Section 1', 'Section 2', 'Section 3']}\n  renderPanel={({id}) => (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{id}</h2>\n      <p>This is the content for {id}.</p>\n    </div>\n  )}\n/>\n```\n\nIn this example, the component will render three sections with the names \"Section 1\", \"Section 2\", and \"Section 3\". The content of each panel is defined by the `renderPanel` function, which takes in an object with an `id` property and returns a div with a heading and some text.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `LayoutSections` component?\n   - The `LayoutSections` component is used to render a list of sections with corresponding panels based on the provided `sectionNames` and `renderPanel` props.\n\n2. What type of data does the `renderPanel` function expect as an argument?\n   - The `renderPanel` function expects an object with an `id` property of type string as its argument.\n\n3. Why is the `key` prop not included in the `div` elements being rendered in the `map` function?\n   - It is not necessary to include a `key` prop in this case since the `div` elements are not being dynamically added or removed from the list. The `key` prop is typically used to help React efficiently update the DOM when elements are added or removed from a list.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/LayoutSections.md"}}],["626",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/LayoutTabs.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports two React components: `Tabs` and `LayoutTabs`. These components are used to create tabbed interfaces in a web application. \n\nThe `Tabs` component takes in an `input` prop, which is a `Node` object from the `@wandb/weave/core` library. This `Node` object is used to query for the names of the tabs to be displayed. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of the query, so that it is only re-executed when the `tabNamesQuery.result` value changes. The `tabNames` variable is then set to either the result of the query or a default value of `['loading...']`. The `Tabs` component then maps over the `tabNames` array to create a `Tab` component for each tab. The `active` prop is set to `true` if the current index matches the `activeIndex` prop, and an `onClick` handler is set to update the `activeIndex` prop when a tab is clicked.\n\nThe `LayoutTabs` component is a higher-level component that uses the `Tabs` component to create a tabbed interface. It takes in an array of `tabNames` and a `renderPanel` function that is used to render the content of each tab. The `activeIndex` state is managed by the `useState` hook and is initially set to `0`. The `Tabs` component is then rendered with the `tabNames` prop set to a `constStringList` object created from the `tabNames` array. The `Content` component is rendered with the result of calling the `renderPanel` function with an object containing the `id` of the currently active tab.\n\nThe `Tabs` and `LayoutTabs` components use the `styled-components` library to style their elements. The `TabsContainer` component is a container for the `Tab` components and has a horizontal scrollbar if the tabs overflow the container. The `Tab` component is a clickable tab with a minimum width of `50px` and a maximum width of `100px`. The `active` prop is used to style the active tab with a teal underline, while inactive tabs are styled with gray text.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes in a set of props that define its behavior and appearance. \n\nThe `NumberContentEditableProps` interface defines the props that can be passed to the component. These include the class name, a reference to the inner HTML element, a boolean flag to indicate whether the input should accept floating-point numbers, the minimum and maximum values that can be entered, and several event handlers for when the input is changed, focused, or blurred. \n\nThe `unescapeString` function is a helper function that takes in a string and returns the unescaped text content of an HTML element. This function is used to convert the inner HTML of the content-editable span element into plain text before passing it to the `onTempChange` callback function. \n\nThe `NumberContentEditable` component uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the state of the input element. The `fallbackRef` is used as a reference to the inner HTML element if no other reference is provided. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the inner HTML of the content-editable span element when the `value` prop changes. \n\nThe component returns a content-editable span element that is styled with the class name passed in as a prop. The `onKeyDown` event handler is used to capture the user's input and handle the Enter key press. The `onFocus` and `onBlur` event handlers are used to handle when the input is focused and blurred, respectively. \n\nWhen the input is blurred, the `onBlur` event handler is called. This handler checks if the input is a valid number and calls the `onChange` callback function with the parsed value. If the input is not a valid number, the inner HTML of the content-editable span element is reset to the previous value. \n\nOverall, the `NumberContentEditable` component provides a flexible and customizable way for users to input numbers in the `weave` project. Here is an example of how the component can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport NumberContentEditable from './NumberContentEditable';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleChange = (newValue) => {\n    setValue(newValue);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <NumberContentEditable\n        value={value}\n        onChange={handleChange}\n        float\n        min={0}\n        max={100}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `PanelAnyObjProps` type is defined as a type alias for `PanelProps` from the `./panel` module, with the generic type argument set to `typeof inputType`. `inputType` is defined as a string literal type with the value `'any'`.\n\nThe `PanelAnyObj` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `../../react` module to retrieve the value of the `input` prop passed to it. It then uses the `useGatedValue` hook from the `../../hookUtils` module to ensure that the component only renders once the `nodeValueQuery` object has finished loading. If `nodeValueQuery.loading` is true, the component returns a `Panel2Loader` component. Otherwise, it returns a `pre` element that displays the result of `JSON.stringify(nodeValueQuery.result, undefined, 2)`.\n\nThe `Spec` object is an object that defines the specifications for the `PanelAnyObj` component. It has three properties: `hidden`, `id`, and `Component`. `hidden` is a boolean that is set to `true`, indicating that the component should be hidden. `id` is a string that is set to `'any-obj'`, which is used to identify the component. `Component` is a reference to the `PanelAnyObj` component.\n\nThis module is likely used in a larger project to define a panel that displays the value of an input object of type `any`.

It also imports `CGReact` and `Panel2` from other files in the project.\n\nThe component takes in a single prop, `inputType`, which is of type `PanelProps<typeof inputType>`. This prop is used to query the artifact version aliases for a given artifact alias using the `useNodeValue` hook from `CGReact`. The query is performed using the `opArtifactAliasAlias` operation from `Op`, which takes in an `artifactAlias` parameter.\n\nIf the query is still loading, the component renders a `Panel2Loader` component. If the query returns null, the component renders a simple div with a dash. Otherwise, the component renders a list of `Tag` components, one for each artifact version alias returned by the query. Each `Tag` component is given a `name` prop equal to the artifact version alias, a `colorIndex` prop equal to `TagType.ALIAS`, and a `noun` prop equal to \"alias\".\n\nThe component is styled using `styled-components`. The `Wrapper` component is a styled `div` that sets several CSS properties, including `width`, `height`, `overflow-x`, `overflow-y`, `margin`, `text-align`, `wordbreak`, `display`, `flex-direction`, `align-content`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `-ms-overflow-style`, `scrollbar-width`, and `-webkit-scrollbar`. The `Wrapper` component is used to wrap the list of `Tag` components.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a list of artifact version aliases for a given artifact alias.

This could be useful for a variety of applications, such as audio processing or analysis.\n\nOther parts of the `weave` project can import this `inputType` constant and use it to ensure that the input they are providing is of the correct type. For example, if there is a function that processes audio files, it could include a parameter that requires the `inputType` constant to be passed in. This would help to ensure that the function is only called with the correct type of input.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in the larger `weave` project:\n\n```\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction processAudioFile(file: typeof inputType) {\n  // code to process audio file\n}\n\nconst myAudioFile = { type: 'audio-file' };\nprocessAudioFile(myAudioFile); // this will work\n\nconst myImageFile = { type: 'image-file' };\nprocessAudioFile(myImageFile); // this will throw an error because the input type is incorrect\n```\n\nIn this example, the `processAudioFile` function requires an input of the same type as the `inputType` constant. The function can be called with an object that has a `type` property set to `'audio-file'`, but will throw an error if an object with a different `type` property is passed in. This helps to ensure that the function is only called with the correct type of input.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `inputType` constant?\n   \n   Answer: The `inputType` constant is used to define the type of input as an audio file.\n\n2. Why is the `as const` keyword used in the code?\n   \n   Answer: The `as const` keyword is used to ensure that the `type` property of the `inputType` constant is a literal type and cannot be changed.\n\n3. Is the `inputType` constant used anywhere else in the project?\n   \n   Answer: Without further context, it is unclear if the `inputType` constant is used elsewhere in the project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelAudio/common.md"}}],["634",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelAudio/index.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a `Spec` object that is used to specify the properties of a panel in the `weave` project. The `Spec` object has four properties: `id`, `Component`, `inputType`, and `displayName`.\n\nThe `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the panel. In this case, the `id` is set to `'audio-file'`.\n\nThe `Component` property is a React component that is used to render the panel. The `React.lazy()` function is used to lazily load the component, which means that it will only be loaded when it is actually needed. The component is imported from the `./Component` file.\n\nThe `inputType` property is imported from the `./common` file. It is a constant that specifies the type of input that the panel expects. \n\nThe `displayName` property is a string that is used to display the name of the panel in the user interface. In this case, it is set to `'Audio'`.\n\nThis `Spec` object is used in the larger `weave` project to define the properties of a specific panel. For example, it could be used to define a panel that allows users to upload and play audio files. \n\nHere is an example of how this `Spec` object could be used in the `weave` project:\n\n```javascript\nimport {Spec} from 'weave';\n\nconst audioPanel = {\n  ...Spec,\n  id: 'audio-file',\n  displayName: 'Audio Player',\n  Component: AudioPlayer,\n  inputType: 'audio',\n};\n\n// Use the audioPanel object to render the panel in the UI\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `audioPanel` object is created by spreading the `Spec` object and then overriding some of its properties. The `Component` property is set to a custom `AudioPlayer` component, and the `displayName` property is changed to `'Audio Player'`. The `audioPanel` object can then be used to render the panel in the user interface.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `Panel2` import is likely a module or component from another file in the `weave` project. It is used to define the `PanelSpec` object in this file.\n2. What is the significance of the `React.lazy` function being used to import the `Component`?\n   - The `React.lazy` function is used to lazily load the `Component` module, which means it will only be loaded when it is actually needed in the application. This can help improve performance by reducing the initial load time.\n3. What is the purpose of the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The `inputType` variable is likely a constant or function defined in the `common` module or file.

However, it appears that it was intended to be used as a panel component in the larger `weave` project. \n\nThe `Spec` object exports a `PanelSpec` object that defines the properties of the `PanelAuto` component. It has a `hidden` property that is set to `false`, an `id` property that is set to `'Auto'`, a `Component` property that is set to the `PanelAuto` component, and an `inputType` property that is set to `'any'` as a constant. \n\nThe `ChildPanel` component that is being rendered by `PanelAuto` is imported from a file called `ChildPanel`, and the `Panel2` module is imported and aliased as `Panel2`.

The component takes in props of type `PanelBarChartProps`, which is defined as a type alias for `Panel2.PanelProps<typeof inputType>`. The `inputType` object is imported from a file called `common.ts` in the same directory.\n\nThe `PanelBarChart` component first defines two constants, `BAR_CHART` and `BAR_CHART_COLORED`, which are both Vega-Lite visualization specifications for a simple bar chart. The only difference between the two is that `BAR_CHART_COLORED` includes a `color` encoding that maps a `color` field to the color of the bars. Both specifications use the `wandb` dataset and take in a `title` prop and two fields, `value` and `label`, for the x and y axes, respectively.\n\nThe component then uses the `useColorNode` hook from `../panellib/libcolors.ts` to get the color node for the input path. If the color node is not a void node, the component sets `isColorable` to true and gets the color node value using `CGReact.useNodeValue`. The component also gets the node value for the input path using `CGReact.useNodeValue` and stores it in `nodeValue`.\n\nThe component then uses `React.useMemo` to compute the data for the bar chart based on `nodeValue` and `colorNodeValue`. If `nodeValue.result` is an array, the component maps over it and creates an object for each item with a `key` field set to the index and a `value` field set to the item's value. If `isColorable` is true, the component also sets a `color` field for each object using the corresponding value from `colorNodeValue.result`. If `nodeValue.result` is an object, the component maps over its entries and creates an object for each entry with a `key` field set to the key and a `value` field set to the value.\n\nIf `nodeValue.loading` or `colorNodeValue.loading` is true, the component returns a `Panel2Loader` component. Otherwise, if `data` is empty, the component returns an empty fragment. Otherwise, the component renders a `CustomPanelRenderer` component from `@wandb/weave/common/components/Vega3/CustomPanelRenderer.tsx` with the appropriate Vega-Lite specification (`BAR_CHART` or `BAR_CHART_COLORED`), data, and user settings. The user settings include field settings for `label`, `value`, and `color`, as well as a string setting for `title`.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to render a bar chart for a given input path. The `PanelBarChart` component takes care of computing the data for the chart based on the input value and color node value, and it uses the `CustomPanelRenderer` component to render the chart using Vega-Lite. The `PanelBarChart` component can be used in conjunction with other panel components to create a dashboard for visualizing and analyzing data.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the difference between `BAR_CHART` and `BAR_CHART_COLORED`?\n- `BAR_CHART` is a simple bar chart with default colors, while `BAR_CHART_COLORED` allows the user to specify a color field and uses that field to color the bars.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBarChart/Component.md"}}],["637",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBarChart/common.ts)\n\nThe `inputType` constant in the `weave` project is an object that defines the expected input type for a function or method. The object has a `type` property that is set to `'union'` and a `members` property that is an array of two objects. \n\nThe first object in the `members` array is a dictionary type with an `objectType` property that is also a union type. The `objectType` property can be either `'none'` or `'number'`.

What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code imports several modules from other files, including React, `CGReact`, `Panel2`, `PanelComp`, and `PanelString.styles`. It also uses a type definition called `PanelBooleanProps` and a constant called `inputType` from a file called `common`.\n3. What is the role of the `nodeValueQuery` variable and how is it used?\n   - `nodeValueQuery` is an object that contains the result of a query for the value of a node. It is obtained using the `useNodeValue` hook from `CGReact` and passed as a prop to the `PanelBoolean` component. The loading state of the query is checked first, and if it is true, a loading spinner is displayed. If the result of the query is null, an empty container is displayed. Otherwise, the boolean value is used to determine the background color, text color, and text content of the pill-shaped element that is rendered.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBoolean/Component.md"}}],["644",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBoolean/common.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a constant variable called `inputType` that is used to specify the type of input that can be accepted by a function or method in the larger project. The `inputType` is an object that has two properties: `type` and `members`. \n\nThe `type` property is a string that is set to `'union'` using the `as const` syntax to ensure that the value cannot be changed later. This indicates that the input type is a union type, which means that it can accept multiple types of input. \n\nThe `members` property is an array of strings that specifies the different types of input that can be accepted. In this case, the `members` array contains two strings: `'none'` and `'boolean'`. This means that the function or method that uses this `inputType` can accept either no input or a boolean value as input.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to ensure that the input to a function or method is of the correct type. For example, if a function requires a boolean input, the developer can use the `inputType` object to specify that only `'none'` or `'boolean'` input is accepted. This helps to prevent errors and improve the overall reliability of the code.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used:\n\n```\nfunction myFunction(input: typeof inputType) {\n  // code that uses the input\n}\n\nmyFunction({ type: 'union', members: ['none', 'boolean'] }); // valid input\nmyFunction({ type: 'union', members: ['string', 'number'] }); // invalid input\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `inputType` constant?\n   - The `inputType` constant defines a union type that can only be one of two possible values: `'none'` or `'boolean'`.\n2. Why is the `type` property assigned the value `'union' as const`?\n   - The `type` property is assigned the value `'union' as const` to ensure that it is a constant value that cannot be changed at runtime.\n3. Can the `members` array be modified or added to at runtime?\n   - No, the `members` array is also assigned as a constant value and cannot be modified or added to at runtime.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBoolean/common.md"}}],["645",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelBoolean/index.ts)\n\nThe code above is a module that exports a constant called `Spec`.

This variable likely contains code related to common input types used throughout the project. \n\nThe `Spec` constant is an object that contains three properties: `id`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` property is a string that identifies the panel as dealing with boolean input types. The `Component` property is a React component that is lazily loaded using the `React.lazy()` function. This means that the component is only loaded when it is actually needed, which can improve performance. The `inputType` property is a reference to the `inputType` variable imported from the `common` module. \n\nThis module can be used in the larger project by importing the `Spec` constant and using it to create a panel that deals with boolean input types.

The resulting `booleanPanel` variable can then be used in the project to display a panel for boolean input types.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Panel2` import and how is it used in this code?\n   - The smart developer might wonder about the contents of the `../panel` file and how it relates to this code. The `Panel2` import is used to reference the `PanelSpec` type from that file, which is then used to define the `Spec` constant.\n2. What is the significance of the `inputType` variable and where is it defined?\n   - The smart developer might be curious about the `inputType` property used in the `Spec` constant. This variable is imported from a file called `common`, which is likely a shared module used throughout the project.\n3. Why is `React.lazy` used to import the `Component` module and what are the potential benefits?\n   - The smart developer might question the use of `React.lazy` to import the `Component` module.

It uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` library to get the value of the input. Depending on the input value, the component returns a loading spinner, an empty container, or a pill-shaped element that is centered in the panel. The pill is colored green if the value is true and red if the value is false. The text inside the pill is either \"True\" or \"False\" depending on the value.\n\nThe `common.ts` file defines a constant variable called `inputType` that is used to specify the type of input that can be accepted by a function or method in the larger project. The `inputType` is an object that has two properties: `type` and `members`.

These components are used to create a card with tabs that can display different content. \n\nThe `PanelCard` component takes in a `PanelCardProps` object, which is defined as a type alias for `Panel2.PanelProps<typeof inputType, PanelCardConfig>`. `Panel2` is another module in the `weave` project that exports a `PanelProps` interface. `inputType` is a constant string value that is used as a type parameter for `PanelProps`. `PanelCardConfig` is an interface that defines the shape of the configuration object that is passed to the `PanelCard` component. \n\nThe `PanelCard` component renders a `Card` styled component that contains a `CardHeader`, `CardTabs`, and `CardContent`. The `CardHeader` contains a `CardTitle` and `CardSubtitle`, and the `CardTabs` contains a list of `CardTab` components that are generated from the `content` property of the configuration object. The `CardContent` contains a `ChildPanel` component that renders the content of the currently selected tab. \n\nThe `PanelCardConfigEditor` component is used to edit the configuration object that is passed to the `PanelCard` component. It renders a `ConfigPanel.ConfigOption` component that contains a `ConfigPanel.ExpressionConfigField` component. The `ExpressionConfigField` component takes in an `expr` property that is the current value of the `title` property of the configuration object. When the user updates the value of the `ExpressionConfigField`, the `setExpression` function is called with the new value, and the `updateConfig` function is called with a new configuration object that has the updated `title` property. \n\nOverall, the `PanelCard` and `PanelCardConfigEditor` components are used to create a reusable card with tabs that can display different content.

The `Spec` object is a configuration object that defines the `PanelColor` component and its properties.\n\nThe `PanelColor` component takes a single prop called `input`, which is an object that contains the input value. The input value is used to calculate the color of the panel. The `nodeValueQuery` constant is created using the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module. This hook takes the `input` prop and returns an object that contains the result of the query. The `result` property of this object is used to calculate the color of the panel.\n\nThe `maxColor` constant is created using the `Color` class from the `color` module. This class is used to manipulate colors. In this case, the `linkHoverBlue` color from the `globals.styles` module is passed to the `Color` constructor, and then the `fade` method is called with a value of `0.3`. This creates a new color that is a faded version of `linkHoverBlue`.\n\nThe `color` constant is created using the `Color` class as well. If the `nodeValueQuery.result` is `null`, then the color is set to white. Otherwise, the `maxColor` is faded based on the `nodeValueQuery.result` value. The `fade` method takes a value between `0` and `1`, where `0` is the original color and `1` is the faded color.\n\nFinally, the `PanelColor` component returns a `div` element with a style object that sets the background color to the `color` value. The `Spec` object defines the `PanelColor` component and its properties.

Why is `React.lazy()` used to import the `Component` in this code?\n   - The developer might want to know why `React.lazy()` is used to import the `Component` instead of a regular `import` statement. `React.lazy()` is used to lazily load the `Component` only when it is needed, which can improve performance by reducing the initial load time of the application.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelDate/index.md"}}],["655",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/.autodoc/docs/json/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelDate)\n\nThe `PanelDate` component in the `weave` project is responsible for rendering a date value in a specific format. It takes in two props: `input` and `config`. The `input` prop is of type `inputType` and is used to get the value of the date to be rendered. The `config` prop is an optional object that can be used to specify the format in which the date should be rendered.\n\nThe component first uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` library to get the value of the `input` prop. If the value is still loading, it returns a `Panel2Loader` component. If the value is `null`, it returns a simple `-` string.\n\nIf the value is not `null`, the component checks the type of the `input` prop. If it is a timestamp, it converts the value to a `Date` object using the `moment` library. It then formats the date using the `moment` library's `format` method. If a `config` prop is provided, it uses the `format` method with the specified format.\n\nFinally, the component returns a `StringContainer` component from the `PanelString.styles` module, which contains a `StringItem` component that displays the formatted date.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger `weave` project to display dates in a consistent format across different parts of the application. It can be used in conjunction with other components to build more complex UI elements that require date rendering. For example, it could be used in a table component to display dates in a specific column.

The `PanelProps` object is defined in the `Panel` component, which is a higher-order component that provides a common interface for all panels in the `weave` project. \n\nThe `PanelPreviewDir` component renders a `DirView` component, which is a functional component that takes in a `DirMetadata` object and a `path` array as its props. The `DirMetadata` object represents the directory tree structure, and the `path` array represents the current path in the directory tree. \n\nThe `DirView` component renders a `Table` component that displays the directory tree structure. The `Table` component has several `Table.Row` components that represent the directories and files in the directory tree. The `Table.Row` components are rendered conditionally based on whether they represent a directory or a file. \n\nThe `SubdirRow` component is rendered for directories, and it takes in a `DirMetadata` object, a directory name, a `path` array, and a `setFilePath` function as its props. The `SubdirRow` component renders a row in the table that displays the directory name, the number of subfolders and files in the directory, and the size of the directory. \n\nThe `SubfileRow` component is rendered for files, and it takes in a `FileMetadata` object, a file name, a `path` array, and a `setFilePath` function as its props. The `SubfileRow` component renders a row in the table that displays the file name, the file link, the file size, and a download button. \n\nThe `PanelPreviewDir` component also renders a `Pagination` component that allows the user to navigate through the directory tree structure. \n\nOverall, the `PanelPreviewDir` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a directory tree structure in a panel.

By setting the `inputType` constant to `Types.ALL_DIR_TYPE`, the code ensures that all input directories used in the project conform to a specific format. This helps to maintain consistency and avoid errors when processing input data.\n\nIn the larger project, this code may be used in conjunction with other modules to process input data. For example, a module that reads data from a directory may use the `inputType` constant to ensure that the directory contains the correct type of data before attempting to read it. Similarly, a module that processes data may use the `inputType` constant to ensure that the data is in the correct format before processing it.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in a module that reads data from a directory:\n\n```\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction readDataFromDirectory(directory) {\n  if (directory.type !== inputType) {\n    throw new Error(`Invalid directory type: ${directory.type}`);\n  }\n\n  // Read data from directory\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `readDataFromDirectory` function checks the type of the input directory against the `inputType` constant. If the types do not match, an error is thrown. This ensures that the function only attempts to read data from directories that conform to the expected format.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component receives a large number of props, which are used to control the behavior of the panel and its child components.\n\nThe configuration panel is divided into several sections, each of which is responsible for configuring a different aspect of the visualization. The first section contains a dropdown menu that allows the user to select the type of panel to be displayed. This section is only visible if the expression and panel are not locked.\n\nThe second section contains a list of configurable nodes, each of which is rendered using a `PanelComp2` component. The `PanelComp2` component is responsible for rendering the node and its associated configuration options. The `ConfigComponent` module passes a number of props to the `PanelComp2` component, including the node to be rendered, the panel specification, and the current configuration settings.\n\nThe third section is only visible if the current panel is a plot panel and the `weavePlotEnabled` flag is set to `true`. This section contains a button that allows the user to edit the table query associated with the plot.\n\nThe fourth section is only visible if the current panel is a plot panel and the `weavePlotEnabled` flag is set to `true`. This section contains a `PanelComp2` component that is responsible for rendering the plot panel and its associated configuration options.\n\nThe final section contains two buttons that allow the user to apply or discard any changes made to the configuration panel.\n\nOverall, the `ConfigComponent` module is an important part of the Weave visualization system, as it allows users to configure the appearance and behavior of their visualizations. By providing a flexible and extensible configuration panel, Weave makes it easy for users to create complex and sophisticated visualizations with minimal effort.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code is a React component that is part of the `weave` project. The purpose of the project is not clear from this code alone.\n\n2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `ConfigComponent` function?\n- The `ConfigComponent` function takes in a variety of props related to panel configuration and context, and returns a React component that renders a configuration panel for a specific type of panel. The exact inputs and outputs of the function are described in the function signature.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isTablePanelHandler` function?\n- The `isTablePanelHandler` function takes in a `PanelStack` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the panel is a \"table\" panel or a \"merge\" panel with a child that is a \"table\" panel. This is used to conditionally render certain elements in the configuration panel.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/ConfigComponent.md"}}],["665",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/actions.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a function called `ExpressionEditorActions` that returns an array of `NodeAction` objects. This function takes two arguments: `weave` and `updateExp`. `weave` is an instance of the `WeaveInterface` class from the `@wandb/weave/core` module, while `updateExp` is a function that takes a `Node` object as its argument and returns nothing.\n\nThe purpose of this function is to define a set of actions that can be performed on a `Node` object in the context of an expression editor. The `NodeAction` objects returned by this function represent these actions. Each `NodeAction` object has four properties: `name`, `icon`, `isAvailable`, and `doAction`.\n\nThe `name` property is a string that represents the name of the action. The `icon` property is a string that represents the icon associated with the action. The `isAvailable` property is a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the action is currently available. The `doAction` property is a function that performs the action when called.\n\nThe only `NodeAction` object defined in this function is currently commented out. This action is called \"Set Editor Expression\" and its purpose is to update the expression in the editor based on the result of calling a function on the `Node` object passed to it. This action is currently disabled because it can cause hidden operations to be added to the editor.\n\nOverall, this code defines a set of actions that can be performed on a `Node` object in the context of an expression editor. These actions can be used to manipulate the expression in the editor and update it based on the result of calling functions on the `Node` object.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ExpressionEditorActions` function?\n- The `ExpressionEditorActions` function returns an array of `NodeAction` objects that can be used to update an expression editor.\n\n2. Why is the first object in the array commented out?\n- The first object in the array is commented out because it is currently disabled. Applying it to a table cell will put hidden operations into the editor.\n\n3. What is the `updateExp` parameter used for?\n- The `updateExp` parameter is a function that takes a `Node` object as input and updates the expression editor. It is called in the `doAction` method of the `NodeAction` object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/actions.md"}}],["666",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/common.ts)\n\nThis code defines types and interfaces for a panel component in the Weave project. The panel is designed to display an expression, which is represented by an EditingNode object. The code exports two main types: PanelExpressionProps and PanelExpressionConfig. \n\nPanelExpressionProps is a type that extends the PanelProps interface from another file in the project. It includes an \"input\" property that can be either a NodeOrVoidNode object of type \"any\" or a void node. The \"standalone\" property is optional and is used to indicate whether the panel is being displayed on its own or as part of a larger interface.\n\nPanelExpressionConfig is an interface that defines the configuration options for the panel. It includes the expression to be displayed (exp), the ID of the panel (panelId), the configuration options for the panel (panelConfig), and the input type for the panel (panelInputType). It also includes a boolean flag (exprAndPanelLocked) that is used to indicate whether the expression and panel are locked together, and a boolean flag (autoFocus) that is used to indicate whether the panel should be automatically focused when it is first displayed. Finally, there is a temporary flag (__weaveBackendRequired__) that is used to indicate whether any updates were performed with the Weave backend enabled.\n\nThe code also exports a constant called EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL, which is an instance of PanelExpressionConfig. This constant is used as a default configuration for the panel when it is first created.\n\nOverall, this code provides the necessary types and interfaces for a panel component that can display an expression in the Weave project. It allows for flexibility in the input type and configuration options for the panel, and provides a default configuration for new panels.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelExpressionProps` type and how is it different from `PanelProps`?\n- The `PanelExpressionProps` type is a modified version of `PanelProps` that includes an additional `input` property of type `NodeOrVoidNode<typeof inputType>`. This allows the panel to receive a void node as input, which is not possible with the original `PanelProps` type.\n\n2. What is the `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL` object used for?\n- The `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL` object is a default configuration for a panel that has an empty expression (`voidNode()`) and no panel ID or configuration. It also has a `panelInputType` of `'invalid'` to indicate that it is not a valid panel.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `__weaveBackendRequired__` property in `PanelExpressionConfig`?\n- The `__weaveBackendRequired__` property is a temporary state used to determine if any updates were performed with the weave backend enabled. It is intended to be removed once weave python gets to TypeScript parity.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/common.md"}}],["667",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/hooks.ts)\n\nThis code defines a custom React Hook called `usePanelExpressionState` for the Weave project. The hook is responsible for managing the state and interactions of a panel expression, which is a user-defined expression that can be applied to data in a panel. The hook takes `PanelExpressionProps` as input and returns an object containing various state variables and functions to manipulate the panel expression state.\n\nThe hook starts by setting up the initial state for the panel expression, such as the input node, configuration, and variable name based on the input type. It then sets up a stack with the new variables and refines the expression using the `useRefineExpressionEffect` hook. The refined expression is then expanded using the `useExpandedNode` hook.\n\nThe hook provides several utility functions to update the panel expression state, such as `updateExp`, `updatePanelId`, `updatePanelInput`, and `deleteTailPanelOps`. These functions are used to modify the expression, panel ID, panel input, and delete tail panel operations, respectively.\n\nThe hook also manages the synchronization of editing and rendering panel configurations using the `useSynchronizedState` hook. It provides functions to apply or discard editing configurations, such as `applyEditingConfig` and `discardEditingConfig`.\n\nAdditionally, the hook handles panel changes using the `handlePanelChange` function, which updates the panel ID and ejects the panel configuration if necessary. It also tracks panel events using the `trackWeavePanelEvent` function.\n\nIn summary, this code provides a custom React Hook to manage the state and interactions of a panel expression in the Weave project. It handles refining and expanding expressions, updating panel configurations, and managing panel changes.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `useVarNameFromType` function?**\n\n   The `useVarNameFromType` function is a helper function that generates an \"English\"-friendly variable name based on the given type `t`. It takes into account whether the type is a list and returns a pluralized name if necessary.\n\n2. **How does the `useSynchronizedState` function work?**\n\n   The `useSynchronizedState` function is a custom hook that takes an object `obj` as input and returns a stateful value and a function to update it. It ensures that the stateful value is synchronized with the input object by updating the state whenever the input object changes.\n\n3. **What is the purpose of the `makeSpine` function?**\n\n   The `makeSpine` function takes an `EditingNode` as input and returns a string representation of the node's \"spine\" (a sequence of connected nodes) or `null` if the node is not part of a spine. This is useful for tracking the structure of an expression and its connected nodes.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/hooks.md"}}],["668",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelExpression/index.ts)\n\nThe code above is a module that exports a React component called `Spec`.

The first is a type called `PanelExpressionConfig`, which is used to define the configuration of the expression panel. The second is a constant called `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL`, which is an empty expression panel that can be used as a default value.\n\nThis module can be used in the larger `weave` project to render an expression panel. The `Spec` component can be imported and used in other components to display the expression panel. The `PanelExpressionConfig` type and `EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL` constant can be used to define and initialize the expression panel. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Spec, PanelExpressionConfig, EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL } from 'weave';\n\nconst config: PanelExpressionConfig = {\n  // define configuration properties\n};\n\nconst expressionPanel = EMPTY_EXPRESSION_PANEL;\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Spec config={config} panel={expressionPanel} />\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is a flex container that takes up the full height and width of its parent. \n\nThe `EditorBar` component is a flex container that holds the toolbar for the editor. It is positioned at the top of the panel and does not grow or shrink with the size of its contents. \n\nThe `LockToggleButton` component is a button that toggles the lock state of the editor. It is positioned to the right of the toolbar and changes color on hover. \n\nThe `BarButton` component is a button that is used for toolbar buttons. It has no background or border and changes color on hover. \n\nThe `ConfigButton` component is a button that is used to open the configuration panel. It has no background or border and changes color on hover. \n\nThe `PanelHandler` component is a container for the editor content. It is a flex container that grows and shrinks to fill the available space. It can be configured to rotate using a CSS animation. \n\nThe `PanelHandlerContent` component is a container for the editor content.

The `PanelExpressionGraph` component takes in a `PanelExpressionGraphProps` object as its props. The `PanelExpressionGraphProps` type is defined as a `PanelProps` object with a generic type of `typeof inputType`. The `inputType` constant is defined as the string literal type `'any'`.\n\nThe `PanelExpressionGraph` component uses the `useState` hook to define a `bounds` state variable that is initialized to an object with a `width` and `height` property of `400`. The component then renders a `Measure` component from the `react-measure` module. The `Measure` component measures the dimensions of its child component and passes them to a callback function defined in the `onResize` prop. The `bounds` state variable is updated with the new dimensions if they are not null.\n\nThe child component of the `Measure` component is a `div` element that has a `measureRef` prop set to the `measureRef` callback function passed by the `Measure` component. The `div` element has a `height` and `width` of `100%` and an `overflow` of `hidden`. Inside the `div` element, the `ComputeGraphViz` component is rendered with the `node` prop set to the `input` prop passed to the `PanelExpressionGraph` component and the `width` and `height` props set to the `bounds.width` and `bounds.height` values, respectively.\n\nThe `Spec` constant is defined as a `PanelSpec` object from the `panel` module with an `id` property of `'debug-expression-graph'`, a `Component` property set to the `PanelExpressionGraph` component, and an `inputType` property set to the `inputType` constant.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable React component that renders a `ComputeGraphViz` component with dimensions that are dynamically measured by a `Measure` component. This component can be used in a larger project to display a visual representation of a compute graph. An example usage of this component could be to display a compute graph of a machine learning model in a web application.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes an input node and configuration properties to determine how the data should be displayed and interacted with.\n\nThe component has two main modes: `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode`. The `PanelFacetFlexMode` is used when only the x-axis is enabled, and it displays the data in a flex layout. The `PanelFacetGridMode` is used when both x and y axes are enabled, and it displays the data in a grid layout.\n\nBoth modes make use of the `SelectPanel` component, which is responsible for rendering the appropriate panel based on the input node, select function, and other configuration properties. The `SelectPanel` component uses the `usePanelStacksForType` hook to determine the correct panel to render based on the select function's type.\n\nIn `PanelFacetFlexMode`, the data is displayed in a flex layout with each cell wrapped in a `div` element. If the `config.manualSize` property is set, the cells are resizable using the `Resizable` component from the `react-resizable` library.\n\nIn `PanelFacetGridMode`, the data is displayed in a grid layout using CSS Grid. The grid's columns and rows are determined by the unique x and y keys from the input data. Each cell in the grid is also resizable using the `Resizable` component.\n\nThe `PanelFacet` component itself determines which mode to use based on the configuration properties passed to it. If the y-axis is not enabled, it uses the `PanelFacetFlexMode`. Otherwise, it uses the `PanelFacetGridMode`.\n\nExample usage of the `PanelFacet` component:\n\n```jsx\n<PanelFacet\n  input={inputNode}\n  config={config}\n  context={panelContext}\n  updateConfig={updateConfig}\n  updateContext={updatePanelContext}\n/>\n```\n\nOverall, this code file provides a flexible and customizable way to display data in a grid or flex layout, with support for resizable cells and various panel types based on the input data and configuration properties.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `PanelFacet` component and how does it decide between using `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode`?\n\n   **Answer**: The `PanelFacet` component is used to display a grid or flex layout of panels based on the provided configuration. It decides between using `PanelFacetFlexMode` and `PanelFacetGridMode` based on whether the `y` dimension is enabled or not. If `y` is not enabled, it uses the flex mode, otherwise, it uses the grid mode.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `SelectPanel` component handle the case when there is no panel for the given type?\n\n   **Answer**: The `SelectPanel` component checks if the `curPanelId` or `handler` is null. If either of them is null, it renders a `div` with a message stating that there is no panel for the given type.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the resizing of cells work in the `PanelFacetGridMode` component?\n\n   **Answer**: The `PanelFacetGridMode` component uses the `Resizable` component from the `react-resizable` library to handle cell resizing. It maintains a state called `resizingSize` to store the current resizing dimensions and updates the state during the resizing process. Once the resizing is stopped, it updates the cell size in the configuration using the `updateConfig` prop.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFacet/Component.md"}}],["672",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFacet/PanelFacet.styles.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a styled component called `PanelSettings` using the `styled-components` library.

It has a background color of #f6f6f6 and a border radius of 4 pixels. The `min-width` property is commented out, which means it is not currently being used. The `:empty` pseudo-class is used to remove the padding if the component is empty. The `overflow` property is set to `visible`, which means that the content inside the panel will be visible even if it overflows the panel's boundaries. The `max-height` property is also commented out, which means it is not currently being used.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to create panels with consistent styling. For example, if the project has a settings page, the `PanelSettings` component can be used to create panels for different settings categories such as account settings, privacy settings, and notification settings. \n\nHere is an example of how the `PanelSettings` component can be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { PanelSettings } from 'weave';\n\nconst AccountSettingsPanel = () => {\n  return (\n    <PanelSettings>\n      <h2>Account Settings</h2>\n      <p>Change your password, update your email address, and more.</p>\n      {/* additional settings components */}\n    </PanelSettings>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default AccountSettingsPanel;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `PanelSettings` component is used to create a panel for the account settings category.

This component is used to create a tabbed interface for displaying data. The component takes in a list of data as input and creates a tab for each item in the list. When a tab is clicked, the corresponding item is displayed in a child panel.\n\nThe `PanelFacetTabs` component is composed of several sub-components, including `Tabs`, `ChildPanel`, and `ConfigPanel`. The `Tabs` component is responsible for rendering the tabs and handling user interactions. The `ChildPanel` component is responsible for rendering the child panel that displays the selected item. The `ConfigPanel` component is responsible for rendering the configuration options for the component.\n\nThe `PanelFacetTabs` component takes in a configuration object that specifies the properties of the tabs and child panel. The configuration object contains a `tab` property that specifies the expression used to generate the tab labels, and a `panel` property that specifies the configuration for the child panel.\n\nThe `PanelFacetTabs` component uses the `opGroupby` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library to group the input data by the tab labels. The resulting groups are used to generate the tab labels and to display the corresponding items in the child panel.\n\nThe `PanelFacetTabs` component is used in the larger `weave` project to provide a flexible and customizable way to display data in a tabbed interface. The component can be used to display a wide range of data types, including tables, charts, and images. The component can also be customized to meet the specific needs of different projects by modifying the configuration options. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { PanelFacetTabs } from 'weave';\n\nconst data = [\n  { name: 'John', age: 30 },\n  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },\n  { name: 'Bob', age: 40 },\n];\n\nconst config = {\n  tab: varNode({ type: 'string' }, 'name'),\n  panel: {\n    id: 'Table',\n    input_node: varNode({ type: 'list', objectType: 'any' }, 'item'),\n    config: {\n      columns: ['name', 'age'],\n    },\n    vars: {},\n  },\n};\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <PanelFacetTabs input={data} config={config} />\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code defines a React component called `PanelFacetTabs` that renders a tabbed interface for displaying child panels. It also includes a configuration component called `PanelFacetTabsConfigComp` for editing the configuration of the `PanelFacetTabs` component.\n2. What are the TODO items in this code and why are they important?\n- The TODO items are to make the tabs virtualized so that not all of them have to be rendered at once, get rid of the scrollbar, and make the active index part of the configuration so that it can be controlled externally. These are important because they can improve performance and flexibility of the component.\n3. What is the purpose of the `usePanelFacetTabsCommon` hook and what does it return?\n- The `usePanelFacetTabsCommon` hook is used to extract common functionality and state from the `PanelFacetTabs` and `PanelFacetTabsConfigComp` components. It returns an object containing the item type, configuration, and various update functions for the component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFacetTabs.md"}}],["676",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFileJupyter/Component.tsx)\n\nThe code in this file defines a React functional component called `PanelJupyter`. This component is used to render a Jupyter notebook file in a panel within the larger project. \n\nThe component imports the `JupyterViewer` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/JupyterViewer` module, which is used to render the Jupyter notebook file. It also imports the `Op` module from `@wandb/weave/core`, which is used to perform operations on the Jupyter notebook file. Additionally, it imports the `React` library, which is used to define the functional component.\n\nThe `PanelJupyter` component takes in a single prop called `input`, which is of type `inputType`. This prop is used to specify the Jupyter notebook file to be rendered in the panel. \n\nThe component first uses the `Op.opFileContents` function to retrieve the contents of the Jupyter notebook file specified in the `input` prop. It then uses the `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook to get the value of the contents node. If the contents are still loading, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, it checks if the content is null and throws an error if it is.\n\nFinally, the component renders the `JupyterViewer` component with the `raw` prop set to the content of the Jupyter notebook file. The `JupyterViewer` component is wrapped in a `div` with some styling to ensure that it takes up the full width and height of the panel.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to render Jupyter notebook files within a panel in the larger project. It uses the `Op` module to retrieve the contents of the file and the `JupyterViewer` component to render the file.

It then checks that the file name ends with the `.ipynb` extension specified in the `inputType` object. If either of these checks fail, an error is thrown. If both checks pass, the function continues with reading in the file.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \nThis code exports an object called `inputType` with two properties: `type` and `extension`.

This constant is likely used throughout the project to validate and filter image files based on their file extension. \n\n`inputType` is an object that defines a union type with members that correspond to each image file extension in `IMAGE_FILE_EXTENSIONS`.

Each object in the `members` array specifies a `list` type, which means that it can accept a list of files with specific extensions.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\n// Validate user input\nfunction validateInput(input) {\n  if (inputType.members.some(member => {\n    // Check if input matches any of the specified types\n    return member.type === 'list' && input.every(file => {\n      return file.type === 'file' && file.extension === member.objectType.extension;\n    });\n  })) {\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`index.ts` defines a `Spec` object that specifies the properties of a panel in the `weave` project. The `Spec` object has four properties: `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, and `inputType`. The `id` is a unique identifier for the panel, the `displayName` is the name shown in the user interface, the `Component` is a React component used to render the panel, and the `inputType` specifies the type of input that the panel expects.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/panel/textdiff';\n\nconst myPanel = {\n  ...Spec,\n  displayName: 'My File Diff Panel',\n  inputType: {\n    type: 'file',\n    multiple: true,\n  },\n};\n\n// Use myPanel in the project\n```\n\nIn summary, the `PanelFileTextDiff` folder contains code for a component that enables users to compare and highlight differences between two text files in the `weave` project. The component is defined in `Component.tsx`, the input types are specified in `common.ts`, and the panel properties are defined in `index.ts`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFileTextDiff/summary.md"}}],["696",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelFunctionEditor.tsx)\n\nThe `PanelFunctionEditor` component is a React functional component that provides a UI for editing a Weave function. It is used in the larger project to allow users to edit the code of a Weave function in a user-friendly way. \n\nThe component imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave/core` and `lodash` libraries. It also imports two modules from the `./panel` file and a `PanelContextProvider` component from another file. \n\nThe `PanelFunctionEditor` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object that contains an `input` property and an `expr` property. The `input` property is a `ConstNode` object that represents the Weave function to be edited. The `expr` property is a `ConstNode` object that represents the expression to be displayed in the editor. \n\nThe component first extracts the `valueNode` from the `props.input` object and uses the `useNodeValue` hook to get the current value of the `valueNode`. If the `valueQuery` object is still loading, the component displays a \"Loading...\" message. Otherwise, it extracts the `value` from the `valueQuery.result` object. If the `value` is not a function literal, the component throws an error. \n\nThe component then extracts the `inputTypes` from the `value.type.inputTypes` object and creates a `paramVars` object using the `_.mapValues` function from the `lodash` library. The `paramVars` object maps each input type to a variable node with the same name. \n\nThe component then returns a `PanelContextProvider` component that wraps a `WeaveExpression` component. The `PanelContextProvider` component provides the `paramVars` object to the `WeaveExpression` component, which uses it to display the input variables of the Weave function. The `WeaveExpression` component also takes a `setExpression` prop, which is a callback function that is called when the expression is updated. The `updateVal` function is a memoized callback function that updates the `valueNode` object with the new expression. \n\nFinally, the component exports a `Spec` object that contains metadata about the component. The `Spec` object is used by other components to render the `PanelFunctionEditor` component. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport {PanelFunctionEditor} from 'weave';\n\nconst myFunction = constFunction({x: 'number'}, () => voidNode() as any);\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <PanelFunctionEditor\n      input={myFunction}\n      expr={myFunction.val}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes in a configuration object that includes an `inputString` property, which is used as the prompt for the GPT-3 model. The component also takes in an `input` property, which is used as the input to the GPT-3 fine-tuning model.\n\nThe `PanelGpt3Model` component renders a table with two rows. The first row contains an input field where the user can enter a prompt for the GPT-3 model. The second row displays the completion generated by the GPT-3 model in response to the prompt. The completion is obtained by calling the `gpt3model-complete` operation with the prompt as input. The `gpt3model-complete` operation is called on the `gpt3finetune-model` operation, which takes in the `input` property as input. The `gpt3finetune-model` operation is defined elsewhere in the `weave` project.\n\nThe `PanelGpt3Model` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the input field. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of the `callOpVeryUnsafe` function, which is used to call the `gpt3model-complete` operation. The `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook is used to get the result of the `gpt3model-complete` operation.\n\nThe `PanelGpt3Model` component is exported along with a `Spec` object that defines the `id` of the component and the `inputType` that the component expects. The `Spec` object also includes a `Component` property that references the `PanelGpt3Model` component.

It also imports the Panel2 module, which contains the PanelProps type and the inputType object. The PanelProps type is used to define the props that are passed to the PanelHTML component, while the inputType object is used to define the type of the input prop.\n\nThe PanelHTML component uses the useAssetURLFromArtifact hook from the '../useAssetFromArtifact' module to get the URL of the HTML file. The useAssetURLFromArtifact hook takes an inputNode object as an argument and returns an object with two properties: directUrl and loading. The directUrl property contains the URL of the HTML file, while the loading property is a boolean that indicates whether the file is still being loaded.\n\nIf the loading property is true, the component returns the WandbLoader component, which displays a loading spinner. If the directUrl property is null, the component returns a div element with a dash (-) as its content. Otherwise, the component returns an iframe element that displays the HTML file. The iframe element has a title attribute set to \"Html card\", a data-test-weave-id attribute set to \"html-file\", and a sandbox attribute set to \"allow-same-origin allow-scripts\". The style attribute sets the border, height, and width of the iframe element to none, 100%, and 100%, respectively.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger Weave project to display HTML files that are stored in the project's artifacts.

In this case, the `inputType` object specifies that the input should be an HTML file. This information can be used by other parts of the project to ensure that the input is properly validated and processed. \n\nFor example, if there is a function that accepts input from the user, it may check that the input is of the correct type before proceeding with further processing.

This syntax is used to indicate that the value of the property should be treated as a literal type rather than a string type. This can help prevent unintended changes to the value of the property.\n\n3. **Where is this `inputType` variable being used within the `weave` project?**\\\nA smart developer might want to know where this `inputType` variable is being used within the `weave` project.

The main component, `PanelHistogram`, is a React functional component that uses the `react-vega` library to render a histogram based on the input data and configuration. The `PanelHistogramConfig` component provides a configuration panel for the histogram, allowing users to customize the visualization.\n\nThe `common.ts` file exports several functions and interfaces related to creating histograms, such as `useExtentFromData` for calculating the minimum and maximum values of the input data, and `HistogramConfig` interface for defining the configuration options for the histogram. The `PanelHistogramProps` interface combines the input type and configuration interfaces to define the expected props for the histogram panel component.\n\nHere's an example of how to use these components and utilities:\n\n```jsx\nimport {PanelHistogramProps} from 'weave/histogram';\nimport {useEffect, useState} from 'react';\n\nfunction MyHistogramPanel(props: PanelHistogramProps) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<number[]>([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // fetch data from API or other source\n    setData([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);\n  }, []);\n\n  const extent = useExtentFromData(data);\n\n  return (\n    <HistogramPanel\n      input={{data}}\n      config={{mode: 'auto', extent}}\n      onChangeConfig={(config) => console.log(config)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyHistogramPanel` component fetches data from an API and passes it to the `HistogramPanel` component along with the appropriate configuration props. The `useExtentFromData` function is used to calculate the minimum and maximum values of the input data, which are then passed to the `HistogramPanel` component as part of the configuration props. The `onChangeConfig` prop can be used to handle changes to the histogram configuration, such as when the user changes the number of bins or the bin size.\n\nThe `index.ts` file defines a `PanelSpec` object for the histogram component, which contains information about the component, such as its ID, configuration component, input type, and whether it can be displayed in fullscreen mode. This `PanelSpec` object can be used in the larger weave project to define and render a histogram component.\n\nFor example, to render a histogram component with the specified configuration and input data:\n\n```javascript\nimport {Weave} from 'weave';\n\nconst weave = new Weave();\nconst histogram = weave.addComponent('histogram', {\n  data: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n  bins: 5,\n  color: 'blue'\n});\nhistogram.render();\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of the `Weave` class is created, and a histogram component is added with the `addComponent` method.

The `PanelIdCompareProps` type is defined as a type alias of the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel2` module, which is imported at the top of the file. The `PanelProps` type is a generic type that takes in a type argument that specifies the expected input type of the component.\n\nThe `PanelIdCompare` component renders a `div` element that displays the key-value pairs of an object. The object is obtained from the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module, which is imported at the top of the file. The `useNodeValue` hook takes in an input object and returns an object with a `loading` property and a `result` property. The `loading` property is a boolean that indicates whether the result is still being fetched, while the `result` property is the actual result of the fetch operation.\n\nThe `PanelSpec` object is an object that specifies the properties of the panel that will be rendered by the `PanelIdCompare` component. The `id` property is a string that specifies the unique identifier of the panel, while the `Component` property is a reference to the `PanelIdCompare` component.

If the `loading` property of the `nodeValue` object returned by `useNodeValue` is `true`, the component renders a `-` character. Otherwise, the component iterates over the array of objects and counts the number of non-null values for each key using a nested `for` loop. The resulting counts are displayed in a series of `div` elements using the `_.map` function from the `lodash` library.\n\nThe `PanelSpec` object exports a `string` `id` property set to `'id-compare-count'`, a `Component` property set to `PanelIdCompareCount`, and an `inputType` property set to `inputType`.

This file contains code for a React component called `PanelMaybe`, which is used to render child panels without the child panel needing to handle null values. \n\nThe `PanelMaybe` component is a wrapper around the `PanelComp2` component, which is the main component for rendering panels. The purpose of `PanelMaybe` is to provide a special error boundary that allows child panels to be rendered without handling null values. If the child panel throws a `NullResult` error, the error boundary catches the error and renders a placeholder component instead of the child panel. \n\nThe `PanelMaybe` component uses the `useLatchingState` hook to refresh the error boundary when the value of the panel changes. The `useLatchingState` hook is used to latch the value of a state variable. The first value is set immediately and does not change until `openLatch` is called. After `openLatch` is called, the value will not update immediately, but will update on the next render. This is useful for `PanelMaybe` because it allows the error boundary to be refreshed by calling `openLatch`. This waits for the next time the value changes, and then updates the error boundary.\n\nThe `PanelMaybe` component also uses the `useIdFromDeps` hook to generate a unique ID for the error boundary. The `useIdFromDeps` hook takes an array of dependencies and returns a memoized ID that is regenerated when any of the dependencies change. This ensures that the error boundary is refreshed when any of the dependencies change.\n\nThe `PanelMaybe` component is exported as part of the `Spec` object, which is used to convert the input type of the panel to a new type. The `Spec` object contains an `id`, a `displayName`, a `Component`, and a `convert` function. The `convert` function takes an input type and returns a new type. If the input type is not a union type or is not assignable to `none`, the `convert` function returns `null`. Otherwise, the `convert` function returns a new type that is a tagged value with the original tags and a non-nullable type. \n\nOverall, the `PanelMaybe` component is a useful tool for rendering child panels without handling null values. It provides a special error boundary that catches `NullResult` errors and renders a placeholder component instead of the child panel. The `useLatchingState` and `useIdFromDeps` hooks are used to refresh the error boundary when the value of the panel changes.

The code defines two React functional components, `PanelMolecule` and `Molecule`, and an interface `MediaMoleculeProps`. \n\nThe `PanelMolecule` component is responsible for rendering the 3D molecule object in a panel. It takes in the `PanelMoleculeProps` object as a parameter, which contains the input node and the molecule configuration. The component uses the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook to get the asset URL from the input node. If the asset is still loading, the component displays a loading spinner. If the asset is a `.pdb` file, the component renders the 3D molecule object using the `Molecule` component. If the asset is not a `.pdb` file, the component displays an error message. \n\nThe `Molecule` component is responsible for rendering the 3D molecule object. It takes in the `MediaMoleculeProps` object as a parameter, which contains the width, height, direct URL, representation type, and extension of the molecule.

The component also uses a custom panel renderer from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/Vega3/CustomPanelRenderer` module to render the histogram.\n\nThe `PanelMultiHistogram` component first extracts the color node from the input using the `useColorNode` hook. It then extracts the node value using the `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook. The node value is used to generate the data for the histogram. The data is generated by iterating over the rows of the node value and creating an array of objects with `name`, `value`, and `color` properties. The `name` property is either the index of the row or the key of the row object. The `value` property is the value of the row. The `color` property is the color associated with the row if the input has a color node.\n\nThe `PanelMultiHistogram` component then renders the histogram using the `CustomPanelRenderer` component. The `CustomPanelRenderer` component takes in a `spec` object that defines the visualization, a `data` array that contains the data for the visualization, and various other settings. The `spec` object is either `HISTO_SPEC` or `HISTO_SPEC_COLORED`, depending on whether the input has a color node. The `HISTO_SPEC` object defines a simple histogram with bars colored by name. The `HISTO_SPEC_COLORED` object defines a histogram with bars colored by the color node. The `CustomPanelRenderer` component renders the histogram using the `react-vega` library.\n\nFinally, the code exports a `Spec` object that defines the panel specification for the `PanelMultiHistogram` component. The `Spec` object contains the `id`, `displayName`, `Component`, `inputType`, and `canFullscreen` properties. The `id` property is a unique identifier for the panel. The `displayName` property is the name of the panel that is displayed to the user. The `Component` property is the `PanelMultiHistogram` component.

The `PanelMultiStringHistogram` component takes in a set of input data, which is expected to be a list of strings or a list of dictionaries containing string values. The component then generates a histogram of the string values, with the y-axis representing the string values and the x-axis representing the frequency of each string value in the input data.\n\nThe `PanelMultiStringHistogram` component is composed of two sub-components: `PanelMultiStringHistogram` and `PanelMultiStringHistogramInner`. The `PanelMultiStringHistogram` component is responsible for rendering the outer container of the histogram, while the `PanelMultiStringHistogramInner` component is responsible for rendering the actual histogram. The `PanelMultiStringHistogramInner` component takes in the input data and generates a Vega-Lite specification for the histogram. The specification includes information about the data source, the type of visualization, and the encoding of the data. The `PanelMultiStringHistogramInner` component then passes the specification to the `CustomPanelRenderer` component, which is responsible for rendering the Vega-Lite visualization.\n\nThe `PanelMultiStringHistogram` component also includes functionality for handling color-coded histograms. If the input data includes a color node, the `PanelMultiStringHistogramInner` component generates a color-coded histogram, where each string value is associated with a specific color. The color-coded histogram is generated using the same Vega-Lite specification as the non-color-coded histogram, but with additional encoding information for the color scale.\n\nOverall, the `PanelMultiStringHistogram` component is a reusable React component that can be used to generate histograms of string values. The component is designed to be flexible and can handle both non-color-coded and color-coded histograms. The component is also designed to be performant, with optimizations for handling large datasets and rendering the histogram only when it is visible on the screen.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This file contains the implementation of a component called `PanelObject`, which is used to display and edit objects in a key-value table format. \n\nThe `PanelObject` component takes in an `input` object and a `config` object as props. The `input` object is an object with keys and values of various types, and the `config` object is an optional object that contains configuration options for the component. The `PanelObject` component renders a table with rows for each key-value pair in the `input` object. The keys are displayed in the left column, and the values are displayed in the right column. \n\nThe `PanelObject` component uses several other components from the `weave` project to render the values of the object. If the value is a string, number, or date, it is displayed using the `PanelString`, `PanelNumber`, or `PanelDate` components, respectively. If the value is another object, the `PanelObject` component is recursively called to render the nested object. \n\nThe `config` object can contain a `propLimit` property, which limits the number of key-value pairs that are displayed in the table. If the number of key-value pairs in the `input` object exceeds the `propLimit`, only the first `propLimit` pairs are displayed. The `config` object can also contain an `expanded` property, which determines whether the table is initially expanded or collapsed. \n\nThe `PanelObject` component also contains a `PanelObjectConfig` component, which is used to configure the `PanelObject` component. The `PanelObjectConfig` component contains a dropdown menu that allows the user to set the `propLimit` property. \n\nOverall, the `PanelObject` component is a useful component for displaying and editing objects in a key-value table format. It can be used in conjunction with other components from the `weave` project to build complex UIs for displaying and manipulating data structures. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {PanelObject} from 'weave';\n\nconst myObject = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30,\n  address: {\n    street: '123 Main St',\n    city: 'Anytown',\n    state: 'CA',\n    zip: '12345'\n  }\n};\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <PanelObject input={myObject} />\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes an input object that contains a URL to a 3D object file. The component first uses the `useAssetURLFromArtifact` hook to get the URL of the asset from the input object. If the asset is a point cloud, the component renders the point cloud using the `PointCloud` component. If the asset is not a point cloud, the component displays an error message.\n\nThe `PointCloud` component takes the URL of a point cloud file and renders it using the Babylon.js library. The component first loads the point cloud file using the `fetch` API and converts it to a `BabylonPointCloud` object using the `loadPointCloud` function. The component then uses the `babylonLib` state variable to render the point cloud using the `renderJsonPoints` function. If the `controls` prop is provided, the component uses it to control the camera. The component also provides a button to launch a full-screen viewer for the point cloud.\n\nThe code also defines a `Spec` object that specifies the properties of the panel. The `id` property specifies the ID of the panel, the `Component` property specifies the component to render, the `inputType` property specifies the type of the input object, and the `displayName` property specifies the name of the panel.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project that requires rendering 3D objects in a panel. The `PanelObject3D` component can be used to render any 3D object that is supported by the Babylon.js library. The `PointCloud` component can be used to render point clouds in a panel. The `Spec` object can be used to define the properties of the panel.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function takes in three generic type parameters: `FC`, `TC`, and `PC`, which represent the \"from\", \"to\", and \"previous\" configuration types, respectively. The `HasVersion` type is a type alias for an object that has a `configVersion` property of type `number`.\n\nThe function returns an object with two properties: `migrate` and `add`. The `migrate` function takes in a configuration object of type `PC`, `FC`, or `TC`, and returns a migrated configuration object of type `TC`. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property less than the specified `version`, the function will attempt to migrate the configuration object to the specified `version` using the `migratePrevious` function. If `migratePrevious` is not provided, an error will be thrown. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property equal to the specified `version`, the function will apply the specified migration function to the input configuration object and return the migrated configuration object with an incremented `configVersion` property. If the input configuration object has a `configVersion` property greater than the specified `version` plus one, an error will be thrown.\n\nThe `add` function takes in a migration function that migrates a configuration object from type `TC` to a new configuration type `CN`, and returns a new migrator object that can migrate from the original `FC` type to the new `CN` type.

The `DEFAULT_SCALE_TYPE` constant is defined as the string `linear`, which is the default scale type if none is specified. \n\nThe `AxisSettingsPrev` type is defined as a type from the `v9` file that represents the settings for an axis. The `AxisSettingPrev` type is defined as one of the values in the `AxisSettingsPrev` type. \n\nThe `ScaleRange` type is defined as an object with a `field` property that takes a string key and returns a string. The `Scale` type is defined as an object with optional `type`, `range`, and `base` properties. The `type` property is a `ScaleType`, the `range` property is a `ScaleRange`, and the `base` property is a number that is only used for `log` scales. \n\nThe `AxisSetting` type is defined as an object that is the same as `AxisSettingPrev` except that the `scale` property is replaced with a `Scale` or `null`. The `AxisSettings` type is defined as an object with properties that match the keys of `AxisSettingsPrev`, where each property is an `AxisSetting`. \n\nThe `PlotConfig` type is defined as an object that is the same as `v9.PlotConfig` except that the `configVersion` and `axisSettings` properties are replaced with new values. The `configVersion` property is set to the `VERSION` constant, and the `axisSettings` property is an object with properties that match the keys of `AxisSettingsPrev`, where each property is an `AxisSetting`. \n\nThe `migrate` function takes a `v9.PlotConfig` object and returns a new `PlotConfig` object with the same properties as the input object, except that the `configVersion` property is set to the `VERSION` constant. This function can be used to update a configuration object from an earlier version of the library to the current version. \n\nOverall, this file defines types and constants that are used to specify scales and axis settings for plots in the weave library. The `PlotConfig` type is the main configuration object for a plot, and the `migrate` function can be used to update an older configuration object to the current version.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code defines types and constants related to scale and axis settings for a `PlotConfig` object in the `weave` project, but more information is needed to understand the overall purpose of the project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `SCALE_TYPES` constant and how is it used?\n- `SCALE_TYPES` is an array of two string literals representing valid scale types. It is used to define the `ScaleType` type and as a default value for `DEFAULT_SCALE_TYPE`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `migrate` function and how is it used?\n- The `migrate` function takes a `v9.PlotConfig` object and returns a new `PlotConfig` object with the same properties, but with the `configVersion` property set to `VERSION`. It is likely used to update older `PlotConfig` objects to the current version.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v10.md"}}],["737",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v11.ts)\n\nThis code defines several types and interfaces that are used in the larger project called \"weave\". It also exports a function called \"migrate\" that takes a v10.PlotConfig object and returns a new PlotConfig object with some modifications.\n\nThe types defined in this file include ContinuousSelection, DiscreteSelection, AxisSelections, Selection, Signals, SeriesConfig, and PlotConfig. ContinuousSelection and DiscreteSelection are both types that define the possible values for a selection. AxisSelections is an interface that defines the possible selections for the x and y axes. Selection is a union type that can be either a ContinuousSelection or a DiscreteSelection. Signals is an interface that defines the domain and selection signals for the plot. SeriesConfig is a type that extends v10.PlotConfig and adds a seriesName property. PlotConfig is a type that extends v10.PlotConfig and adds a configVersion property and a signals property of type Signals.\n\nThe migrate function takes a v10.PlotConfig object and returns a new PlotConfig object with some modifications. The configVersion property is set to the value of VERSION, which is defined as 11. The signals property is set to an empty object for both domain and selection. The series property is modified by mapping over the series array in the input config object and creating a new object for each series. The new object is created by omitting the \"name\" property from the original series object and adding a new \"seriesName\" property with the value of the original \"name\" property.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to migrate v10 plot configurations to the new format defined in this file. For example, if a user has a v10 plot configuration saved, they can pass it to the migrate function to get a new plot configuration that is compatible with the latest version of the project. Here is an example usage of the migrate function:\n\n```\nimport { migrate } from 'weave';\n\nconst v10Config = {\n  // ... v10 plot configuration ...\n};\n\nconst newConfig = migrate(v10Config);\n\n// newConfig is now a PlotConfig object with the same data as v10Config, but in the new format\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code defines types and interfaces for selections, signals, and plot configurations, and provides a migration function for updating v10 plot configurations to the current version. A smart developer might want to know more about the overall goals and architecture of the `weave` project to understand how this code fits into the larger picture.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `VERSION` constant and how is it used?\n- The `VERSION` constant is used to specify the version number of the current plot configuration format. It is used to update v10 plot configurations to the current version in the `migrate` function. A smart developer might want to know how versioning is handled in the `weave` project and how changes to the plot configuration format are managed.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `migrate` function and how is it used?\n- The `migrate` function takes a v10 plot configuration and returns a new plot configuration that is updated to the current version. It does this by copying over all properties from the original configuration, updating the `configVersion` property to the current version, and transforming the `series` array to remove the `name` property and add a `seriesName` property. A smart developer might want to know how the `migrate` function is used in the `weave` project and how it fits into the overall data migration strategy.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v11.md"}}],["738",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v12.ts)\n\nThe code in this file is part of the larger project called \"weave\".

It then defines a type called \"LazyAxisSelection\", which is a weave node that represents a union of a list of any object type and the value \"none\". This type is used to define the \"domain\" property of the \"Signals\" type, which is a modified version of the \"v11.PlotConfig\" type. The \"Signals\" type is used to define the \"signals\" property of the \"PlotConfig\" type, which is a modified version of the \"v11.PlotConfig\" type that includes the new \"configVersion\" and \"signals\" properties.\n\nThe code also defines two constants: \"LAZY_PATHS\" and \"DEFAULT_LAZY_PATH_VALUES\". \"LAZY_PATHS\" is an array of two string literals that represent the \"x\" and \"y\" properties of the \"domain\" property of the \"Signals\" type. \"DEFAULT_LAZY_PATH_VALUES\" is an object that maps each element of \"LAZY_PATHS\" to the value \"null\".\n\nFinally, the code defines a function called \"migrate\" that takes a version 11 plot configuration object and returns a version 12 plot configuration object.

The function then returns a new plot configuration object that includes the new \"configVersion\" and \"signals\" properties.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger \"weave\" project to migrate version 11 plot configurations to version 12 plot configurations. For example, a user might have a version 11 plot configuration object that they want to use with a new version of the \"weave\" library that requires version 12 plot configurations. They could pass their version 11 plot configuration object to the \"migrate\" function to get a version 12 plot configuration object that can be used with the new version of the library.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` and `v11` imports?\n   - The `weave` import is used to import the `core` module from the `@wandb/weave` library, while the `v11` import is used to import a module from the local `./v11` file.\n2. What is the `LazyAxisSelection` type and how is it used?\n   - The `LazyAxisSelection` type is a type alias for a `weave.Node` object that represents a union of a list of any object type and the value `'none'`. It is used as the type for the `x` and `y` properties of the `domain` property in the `Signals` type.\n3. What is the purpose of the `migrate` function and how does it work?\n   - The `migrate` function takes a `v11.PlotConfig` object as input and returns a `PlotConfig` object with the same properties, except with a `configVersion` of `12` and with the `x` and `y` properties of the `domain` property in the `signals` property converted to `weave.constNode` objects with the `LazyAxisSelection` type.

The file begins by importing two constants, `constNumber` and `constString`, from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. It also imports two modules, `TableState` and `v1`, from other files in the project.\n\nThe file then exports several constants and types related to plotting data. `POINT_SHAPES` is an array of string literals representing the available shapes for data points in a plot. `PointShapeOption` is a type that represents one of the available point shapes. `PLOT_DIMS_UI` is an array of string literals representing the available dimensions for a plot. `DIM_NAME_MAP` is an object that maps the names of dimensions to more user-friendly names.\n\nThe file also exports two interfaces, `SeriesConfig` and `PlotConfig`, that define the structure of data used to configure and plot data. `SeriesConfig` contains an object `dims` that defines the dimensions of the data, including the x-axis, y-axis, color, label, tooltip, point size, and point shape. It also contains a `table` property that represents the data to be plotted. `PlotConfig` contains several properties related to the configuration of the plot, including the version of the configuration, the title of the plot, the axis settings, the legend settings, the vega overlay, the series to be plotted, and the configuration options expanded.\n\nFinally, the file exports a constant `DEFAULT_POINT_SIZE` and a function `migrate` that takes an old version of `PlotConfig` and returns a new version that is compatible with the current version. The `migrate` function adds default point size and shape to the dimensions and table of the old configuration if they are not already present, and then returns a new configuration with the same data in multi-series format.\n\nThis file is an important part of the `weave` project because it defines the structure of data used to configure and plot data.

The function first spreads the properties of the input config object into a new object, then sets the 'configVersion' property to 3. It then maps over the 'series' array of the input config object, spreading each series object into a new object and replacing the 'mark' property with either its original value or null if it is undefined. The resulting array of SeriesConfig objects is then assigned to the 'series' property of the new PlotConfig object, which is returned by the function. \n\nThis function appears to be used for migrating plot configurations from an older version (v2) to a newer version (v3) of the project. It takes an existing v2.PlotConfig object and returns a new PlotConfig object with the same properties, but with the 'configVersion' property set to 3 and the 'mark' property of each series object replaced with a nullable type. This function could be used in the larger project to ensure backwards compatibility with older plot configurations while still allowing for new features and changes in the configuration format. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { migrate } from 'weave';\n\nconst oldConfig = {\n  configVersion: 2,\n  series: [\n    { type: 'line', x: 'x', y: 'y', mark: 'circle' },\n    { type: 'bar', x: 'x', y: 'z' },\n  ],\n};\n\nconst newConfig = migrate(oldConfig);\n\nconsole.log(newConfig);\n// Output: { configVersion: 3, series: [\n//   { type: 'line', x: 'x', y: 'y', mark: 'circle' },\n//   { type: 'bar', x: 'x', y: 'z', mark: null },\n// ] }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This means that the 'axisSettings' property in the PlotConfig type includes all the properties of the v7.PlotConfig['axisSettings'] type, as well as a 'color' property of type v1.AxisSetting.\n\nThe function defined in this file is called 'migrate' and takes a v7.PlotConfig object as its argument. The purpose of this function is to migrate a v7 plot configuration object to the latest version (v8) by adding the 'configVersion' property and modifying the 'axisSettings' property. The function returns a new PlotConfig object with the updated properties. The 'axisSettings' property is modified by adding a 'color' property if it doesn't already exist. This is done using the nullish coalescing operator (??), which checks if the 'color' property is null or undefined and replaces it with an empty object if it is.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to handle plot configuration and migration between different versions of the configuration. For example, if a user has an old v7 plot configuration object, the 'migrate' function can be used to convert it to the latest v8 configuration object. The PlotConfig type can also be used to define variables and functions that require a plot configuration object of the latest version. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { PlotConfig, migrate } from 'weave';\n\nconst oldConfig: v7.PlotConfig = {...}; // an old v7 plot configuration object\nconst newConfig: PlotConfig = migrate(oldConfig); // migrate to the latest v8 configuration object\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code is defining a `PlotConfig` type and a `migrate` function for version 7 to version 8 of the `weave` project.\n\n2. What is the difference between `v1` and `v7` and how are they used in this code?\n- `v1` and `v7` are modules imported into this code and are used to define the `color` property of the `axisSettings` object in the `PlotConfig` type.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `migrate` function and how is it used in the `weave` project?\n- The `migrate` function takes a `v7.PlotConfig` object and returns a `PlotConfig` object with updated `configVersion` and `axisSettings` properties. It is used to update `v7` configurations to the new `v8` format in the `weave` project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v8.md"}}],["746",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlot/versions/v9.ts)\n\nThis code is a module within the larger project called \"weave\". The purpose of this module is to define and export two types of configurations: SeriesConfig and PlotConfig. These configurations are used to define the style and layout of plots and series within the project.\n\nThe module imports two other modules, v7 and v8, which likely contain previous versions of the configurations. The LINE_SHAPE_OPTIONS constant is defined as an array of string literals that represent different line shapes that can be used in the configurations.\n\nThe SeriesConfig type is defined as an object that extends the v7.SeriesConfig type, but with the 'constants' property modified. The 'constants' property is an object that contains various style options for the series, including the line style. The 'lineStyle' property is modified to allow for an additional option, 'short-dashed'.\n\nThe PlotConfig type is defined as an object that extends the v8.PlotConfig type, but with the 'series' and 'configVersion' properties modified. The 'series' property is an array of SeriesConfig objects, which define the style and layout of each series within the plot. The 'configVersion' property is set to 9 to indicate the version of the configuration.\n\nFinally, the module exports a 'migrate' function that takes a v8.PlotConfig object as input and returns a PlotConfig object with the 'configVersion' property set to 9.

What is the purpose of the `weave` project and what does this file specifically contribute to it?\n- This code file exports two types (`SeriesConfig` and `PlotConfig`) and a constant (`LINE_SHAPE_OPTIONS`) that are likely used elsewhere in the `weave` project. The `migrate` function is also included to convert a `v8.PlotConfig` object to a `PlotConfig` object with a `configVersion` of 9.\n\n2.

It takes in a `PanelPlotlyProps` object as a prop, which contains an `updateConfig2` function and an `input` object. The `input` object is expected to be of type `Plotly`, which is defined as a constant object at the top of the file. The `updateConfig2` function is used to update the configuration of the Weave panel.\n\nThe component first checks if `updateConfig2` is not null, and throws an error if it is. It then uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of calling the `callOpVeryUnsafe` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library with the arguments `'Plotly-contents'` and an object containing the `input` prop. This function is used to retrieve the JSON string representation of the Plotly chart data.\n\nThe component then uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to a `div` element, which will be used to render the Plotly chart. It also uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `../../../react` module to get the result of the `jsonStringNode` memoized value. If the `loading` property of the result is true, the component returns early and does not render anything. Otherwise, it parses the JSON string into a `plotlySpec` object and uses the `Plotly.newPlot` function to render the chart in the `div` element. It also attaches event listeners to the `div` element for the `plotly_click` and `plotly_selected` events, which are used to update the `selected` property of the `PanelPlotlyConfig` object passed to `updateConfig2`.\n\nThe `selected` property of the `PanelPlotlyConfig` object can be either an object containing `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin`, and `yMax` properties, or a `Node` object. If the `plotly_selected` event contains a `range.geo` property, the component creates a `selection` object with the `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin`, and `yMax` properties set to the corresponding values from the `range.geo` array. It then calls `updateConfig2` with a new `PanelPlotlyConfig` object containing a `selected` property that is a `Node` object created from the `selection` object using the `toWeaveType` function from the `../toWeaveType` module. If the `plotly_selected` event does not contain a `range.geo` property, the component creates a `selection` object with the `xMin`, `xMax`, `yMin`, and `yMax` properties set to the corresponding values from the `range` object. It then calls `updateConfig2` with a new `PanelPlotlyConfig` object containing a `selected` property that is a `Node` object created from the `selection` object using the `toWeaveType` function. \n\nFinally, the component returns a `div` element with a `data-test-weave-id` attribute set to `\"PanelPlotly\"`, and a `style` object with `width` and `height` properties set to `\"100%\"`. The `ref` attribute of the `div` element is set to the `divRef` object created using the `useRef` hook. This `div` element is where the Plotly chart will be rendered.\n\nExample usage:\n```jsx\nimport {PanelPlotly} from 'weave/panel/plotly';\n\nconst MyPanel = () => {\n  const [config, setConfig] = useState({selected: null});\n\n  const handleUpdateConfig = useCallback((newConfig) => {\n    setConfig((oldConfig) => ({...oldConfig, ...newConfig}));\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <PanelPlotly\n      input={{type: 'Plotly', data: [...], layout: {...}}}\n      updateConfig2={handleUpdateConfig}\n      config={config}\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a React component called `PanelPlotly` that renders a Plotly chart based on input data. It allows users to interact with the chart and select data points or regions.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from external libraries, including `@wandb/weave/core` for core functionality, `plotly.js` for chart rendering, and `react` for building the UI.\n\n3. What is the expected input format for this component and how is it processed?\n- The `PanelPlotly` component expects input data in the form of a `Plotly` object. It uses a `jsonStringNode` to parse the input data and render the chart using `Plotly.newPlot()`. It also listens for user interactions with the chart and updates the component's state accordingly.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlotly/Component.md"}}],["748",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlotly/common.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a constant variable called `inputType` that is exported for use in other parts of the project. The value of `inputType` is an object with a single property called `type` that has a value of `'Plotly'`. The `as any` syntax is used to indicate that the type of the `inputType` object is not known or is not important.\n\nThis code is likely used to specify the type of input data that the project can handle. In this case, it appears that the project can handle input data in the form of Plotly charts. By defining `inputType` as a constant variable, it ensures that the value of `type` cannot be changed elsewhere in the code.\n\nOther parts of the project can import `inputType` and use it to determine how to handle input data. For example, if a user uploads a Plotly chart as input data, the project can check if the input data matches the `inputType` and then process it accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how `inputType` might be used in another part of the project:\n\n```\nimport { inputType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction processData(inputData: any) {\n  if (inputData.type === inputType.type) {\n    // process Plotly chart data\n  } else {\n    // handle other types of input data\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `processData` function takes in some input data and checks if its `type` property matches the `type` property of `inputType`. If they match, the function knows that the input data is a Plotly chart and can process it accordingly. If they don't match, the function can handle the input data in some other way.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `inputType` constant?** \n    The `inputType` constant is used to define the type of input as a Plotly object.\n\n2. **Why is the `any` type used in the definition of `inputType`?** \n    The `any` type is used to allow for flexibility in the type of input that can be accepted by the `weave` project.\n\n3. **Where is the `inputType` constant used in the `weave` project?** \n    Without further context, it is unclear where the `inputType` constant is used in the `weave` project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlotly/common.md"}}],["749",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelPlotly/index.ts)\n\nThe code above is a module that exports a constant object called `Spec`.

What is the `registerPanelFunction` method and what does it do?\n- The `registerPanelFunction` method is called with the `id`, `inputType`, and `equivalentTransform` properties of the `Spec` object as arguments. More information about the purpose of this method and how it is used within the `weave` project is needed to fully understand its functionality.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/index.md"}}],["755",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/op.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports two functions: `outputType` and `equivalentTransform`. These functions are used to define the output type and transformation logic for a panel in the larger project.\n\nThe `outputType` function takes an input type and returns a list of typed dictionaries. If the input type is a table type, the function returns a list of typed dictionaries with an empty dictionary as the source type. Otherwise, the function returns a list of typed dictionaries with the input type as the source type. The output type also includes a minimum and maximum length for the list.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `outputType` function:\n\n```\nimport { outputType } from 'weave';\n\nconst inputType = list(typedDict({ x: 'number', y: 'number' }));\nconst output = outputType(inputType);\n\nconsole.log(output);\n// Output: list(typedDict({ source: listObjectType(list(typedDict({ x: 'number', y: 'number' }))), projection: list('number') }), listMinLength(list(typedDict({ x: 'number', y: 'number' }))), listMaxLength(list(typedDict({ x: 'number', y: 'number' }))))\n```\n\nThe `equivalentTransform` function takes an input node, configuration object, and a refine type function. If the input node is a table type, the function normalizes the table and refines the type. Then, the function applies a 2D projection algorithm to the input node and returns the result as a new node. If the resolved type is not assignable to the expected return type, the function returns a default node.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `equivalentTransform` function:\n\n```\nimport { equivalentTransform } from 'weave';\n\nconst inputNode = constNodeUnsafe(list(typedDict({ x: 'number', y: 'number' })), [{ x: 1, y: 2 }, { x: 3, y: 4 }]);\nconst config = { projectionAlgorithm: 'tsne', inputCardinality: 'one', inputColumnNames: ['x', 'y'], algorithmOptions: { perplexity: 30, learningRate: 200, iterations: 1000 } };\nconst refineType = async (node) => node;\n\nconst outputNode = await equivalentTransform(inputNode, config, refineType);","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/op.md"}}],["756",{"pageContent":"console.log(outputNode);","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/op.md"}}],["757",{"pageContent":"//

The function also enforces a minimum and maximum length for the `source` field.\n\n3. What is the `equivalentTransform` function and what does it do?\n- The `equivalentTransform` function is a PanelSpec equivalent transform function that takes an input node, a configuration object, and a refine type function. It first checks if the input node is a table type and normalizes it if necessary. If the resolved type is not assignable to the expected return type, it returns a default node.

It exports two components: `PanelProjectionConverter` and `PanelProjectionConverterConfig`. The former is a dummy component that throws an error if it is rendered directly, while the latter is the actual configuration panel that can be used in the larger project.\n\nThe `PanelProjectionConverterConfig` component takes two props: `input` and `config`. The `input` prop is an object that describes the input data to the projection algorithm, while the `config` prop is an object that describes the configuration of the projection algorithm. The component returns a configuration panel that allows the user to modify the configuration of the projection algorithm.\n\nThe module also provides utility functions to process the configuration object and the input data to generate a new configuration object that is used to populate the configuration panel. The configuration panel allows the user to select the projection algorithm (PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP), the type of input data (single embedding column or many numeric columns), and the input data itself.\n\nIn addition, the module defines various type definitions and constants related to the projection algorithms, such as `ProjectableType`, `inputType`, and the configuration types for PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP algorithms. These types and constants ensure that the code is properly typed and structured.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Spec } from 'weave/projection';\n\n// Define a new panel specification\nconst myPanelSpec = {\n  id: 'my-panel',\n  displayName: 'My Panel',\n  Component: MyPanelComponent,\n  ConfigComponent: MyPanelConfigComponent,\n  inputType: MyInputType,\n  outputType: MyOutputType,\n  equivalentTransform: MyEquivalentTransform,\n};\n\n// Register the panel function\nPanel2.registerPanelFunction(\n  myPanelSpec.id,\n  myPanelSpec.inputType,\n  myPanelSpec.equivalentTransform!\n);\n\n// Use the panel in the user interface\n<Panel2.Panel\n  spec={myPanelSpec}\n  data={myData}\n  onDataChanged={handleDataChanged}\n/>\n```\n\nOverall, the `PanelProjectionConverter` module provides a flexible and extensible configuration panel for a data projection algorithm that can be used in the larger project. The module ensures that the input data and configuration objects are properly typed and structured, and it provides utility functions to process the input data and configuration objects to generate a new configuration object for the panel.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/summary.md"}}],["763",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/types.ts)\n\nThis file contains various type definitions and constants related to the `weave` project. \n\nThe `ProjectableType` constant is an object that represents a list of objects with typed properties. It is used to define the structure of data that can be projected onto a panel. The `inputType` constant is an object that represents a union of two types: `ProjectableType` and `TableType.ConvertibleToDataTableType`. This is used to define the input type for the `PanelProjectionConverter` function, which is responsible for converting input data into a format that can be projected onto a panel.\n\nThe file also defines several type definitions related to different projection algorithms. The `tsneAlgorithmOptionsType` type represents the options for the t-SNE algorithm, which is used for dimensionality reduction. The `pcaAlgorithmOptionsType` type represents the options for the PCA algorithm, which is also used for dimensionality reduction. The `umapAlgorithmOptionsType` type represents the options for the UMAP algorithm, which is used for non-linear dimensionality reduction.\n\nFinally, the file defines the `PanelProjectionConverterConfigType` type, which is used to configure the `PanelProjectionConverter` function. This type includes several properties, including the projection algorithm to use, the input cardinality (single or multiple), the input column names, and the algorithm options. \n\nOverall, this file provides the necessary type definitions and constants for the `weave` project to perform data projection and dimensionality reduction. Developers can use these types and constants to ensure that their code is properly typed and structured. For example, they can use the `PanelProjectionConverterConfigType` type to configure the `PanelProjectionConverter` function and ensure that the input data is properly formatted. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { PanelProjectionConverterConfigType } from 'weave';\n\nconst config: PanelProjectionConverterConfigType = {\n  projectionAlgorithm: 'tsne',\n  inputCardinality: 'multiple',\n  inputColumnNames: ['x', 'y', 'z'],\n  algorithmOptions: {\n    tsne: {\n      perplexity: 30,\n      learningRate: 200,\n      iterations: 1000,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n// Use the config to call the PanelProjectionConverter function\nconst projectedData = PanelProjectionConverter(data, config);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this file fit into it?\n- This code file is defining several types and constants related to panel projection conversion, but without more context it is unclear how this fits into the overall purpose of the `weave` project.\n\n2. What is the difference between `ProjectableType` and `inputType`?\n- `ProjectableType` is a constant representing a list of objects with a specific structure, while `inputType` is a union type that can contain either `ProjectableType` objects or objects of a different type defined in another file.\n\n3. What are the possible values for `projectionAlgorithm` and what do they represent?\n- `projectionAlgorithm` can be one of three string literals: `'tsne'`, `'pca'`, or `'umap'`. These represent different algorithms that can be used for panel projection conversion, and each has its own set of options defined in the `algorithmOptions` object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/types.md"}}],["764",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelProjectionConverter/util.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a file that exports two functions: `getValidColumns` and `processConfig`. \n\nThe `getValidColumns` function takes a `Type` input and returns an object with two properties: `validEmbeddingColumns` and `validNumericColumns`. The function first retrieves the inner type of the input, which is a nullable taggable value of a list object type. If the inner type is assignable to a typed dictionary, the function uses the `allObjPaths` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` library to retrieve all possible paths in the dictionary. It then filters the paths to find those that are assignable to a `maybe(list('number'))` type and those that are assignable to a `maybe('number')` type, and maps the paths to their respective column names. The function returns an object with the two arrays of column names.\n\nThe `processConfig` function takes two inputs: a configuration object and a `Node` object with a generic type `U`. The function first calls `getValidColumns` with the `type` property of the `inputNode` object to retrieve the valid column names. It then sets the `projectionAlgorithm` property of the output object to the `projectionAlgorithm` property of the input configuration object, or to `'pca'` if the property is not defined. It sets the `inputCardinality` property to `'single'` if there is at least one valid embedding column, or to `'multiple'` otherwise, or to the `inputCardinality` property of the input configuration object if it is defined. It sets the `inputColumnNames` property to the `inputColumnNames` property of the input configuration object, or to an empty array if the property is not defined. If the `inputCardinality` is `'single'`, the function checks if the `inputColumnNames` array contains a valid embedding column name, and sets it to an empty array if it does not. If the `inputColumnNames` array is empty and there is at least one valid embedding column, the function sets it to an array containing the first valid embedding column name. If the `inputCardinality` is `'multiple'`, the function checks if the `inputColumnNames` array contains only valid numeric column names, and sets it to an empty array if it does not. If the `inputColumnNames` array is empty and there are valid numeric column names, the function sets it to an array containing all valid numeric column names. Finally, the function sets the `algorithmOptions` property of the output object to an object with properties for the `'pca'`, `'tsne'`, and `'umap'` algorithms, with default values or values from the input configuration object if defined.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to process a configuration object for a panel projection converter, which takes a dataset and projects it onto a two-dimensional plane for visualization. The `getValidColumns` function is used to retrieve the valid column names from the dataset, and the `processConfig` function is used to set the configuration options for the converter based on the input configuration object and the valid column names. An example usage of the `processConfig` function might look like this:\n\n```\nimport { Node } from '@wandb/weave/core';\nimport { processConfig } from 'weave';\n\nconst config = {\n  projectionAlgorithm: 'tsne',\n  inputCardinality: 'single',\n  inputColumnNames: ['embedding'],\n  algorithmOptions: {\n    tsne: {\n      perplexity: 50,\n      learningRate: 5,\n      iterations: 100,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nconst inputNode: Node<{embedding: number[]}> = {\n  type: {embedding: list('number')},\n  value: {embedding: [1, 2, 3]},\n};\n\nconst panelProjectionConverterConfig = processConfig(config, inputNode);\nconsole.log(panelProjectionConverterConfig);\n// Output: {\n//   projectionAlgorithm: 'tsne',\n//   inputCardinality: 'single',\n//   inputColumnNames: ['embedding'],\n//   algorithmOptions: {\n//     pca: {},\n//     tsne: {\n//       perplexity: 50,\n//       learningRate: 5,\n//       iterations: 100,\n//     },\n//     umap: {\n//       neighbors: 15,\n//       minDist: 0.1,\n//       spread: 1.0,\n//     },\n//   },\n// }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The panel query component is used to filter data in a table based on a set of conditions. The code imports various modules and interfaces, including React, Panel, Table, and ConfigPanel, among others. \n\nThe `PanelQuery` component is the main component that renders the panel query. It takes in a set of props, including `tableState`, `pinnedRows`, `conditions`, and `dims`. The `conditions` prop is an array of objects that contain an `expression` and an `editor`. The `expression` is a filter expression that is used to filter the data in the table, while the `editor` is a child panel that is used to edit the filter expression. \n\nThe `PanelQuery` component renders a list of `PanelQueryConditionComponent` components, one for each condition in the `conditions` array. The `PanelQueryConditionComponent` component renders the filter expression and the child panel used to edit the expression. \n\nThe `PanelQueryConfigComponent` component is used to configure the panel query. It renders a list of `PanelQueryConditionConfigComponent` components, one for each condition in the `conditions` array. The `PanelQueryConditionConfigComponent` component is used to configure the filter expression and the child panel used to edit the expression. \n\nThe `toFilterExpression` function is used to convert the filter expression into a filter clause that can be used to filter the data in the table. The function takes in a `weave` object, an `input` object, and a `config` object. The `weave` object is used to map the filter expression to the correct output type, while the `input` object is used to create a new variable for the filter expression. The `config` object is used to create the filter clause. \n\nThe `defaultPanelQuery` function is used to initialize the panel query with default values. It creates an empty table state and adds an empty column to the table state. It also creates a `textColId` variable that is used to identify the text column in the table. \n\nThe `conditionEditorsForType` function is used to determine which child panel editors are available for a given filter expression. It takes in a `type` object and returns an array of `ConditionEditorSpec` objects that are available for that type. \n\nThe `EDITOR_SPECS` object is used to define the child panel editors that are available for the panel query. It contains an object for each editor that defines the `panelId`, `initEditor`, and `toFilterClause` functions. \n\nOverall, the `weave` module contains code for a panel query component that can be used to filter data in a table based on a set of conditions. The component is highly configurable and can be used in a variety of different contexts.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how is it being used in this code?\n- The `weave` module is being used to provide context for the code, specifically for the `toFilterExpression` function which takes in a `Weave` object as one of its parameters. It is not clear from this code what the overall purpose of the `weave` module is.\n\n2. What is the difference between `PanelQueryConditionConfigComponent` and `PanelQueryConditionComponent`?\n- `PanelQueryConditionConfigComponent` is used to render the configuration options for a single condition in the `PanelQuery` component, while `PanelQueryConditionComponent` is used to render the actual condition and its associated editor. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `EDITOR_SPECS` object and how is it being used in this code?\n- The `EDITOR_SPECS` object is a mapping of editor IDs to their respective specifications, which include functions for initializing the editor and converting its input into a filter clause. It is being used in the `toFilterExpression` function to determine which editor to use for a given condition based on the type of its expression.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelQuery.md"}}],["766",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelRef.tsx)\n\nThe code above is a module that exports two objects: `PanelRef` and `Spec`. The `PanelRef` object is a React functional component that renders a panel displaying the name of a reference. The `Spec` object is a panel specification that defines the `PanelRef` component as the component to be used for a panel with an ID of \"Ref\".\n\nThe `PanelRef` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object that contains an input property. The input property is expected to be a reference to a resource, represented as a URL string. The component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to fetch the value of the input reference. If the value is still loading, the component returns a `Panel2Loader` component, which is presumably a loading spinner or placeholder.

The `entities` variable is then created using the `useMemo` hook to extract the result from the `entitiesValue` object.\n\nThe `cardConfig` variable is created using the `useConfigChild` hook from the `../panel` module. This hook takes four arguments: the name of the child configuration, the parent configuration, the update function for the parent configuration, and the child configuration itself. The child configuration is an object that contains the title, subtitle, and content of the card. The content is an array of objects, one for each entity, that contains the name of the entity and a data node that is used to get the projects for that entity. The `makeTableState` function is called to create the table state for each entity.\n\nFinally, the `PanelCard` component from the `../PanelCard` module is rendered with the appropriate props. The `PanelCard` component takes an `input` prop, which is set to `voidNode()`, a `config` prop, which is set to `cardConfig.config`, an `updateConfig` prop, which is set to `cardConfig.updateConfig`, a `context` prop, which is set to `props.context`, an `updateContext` prop, which is set to `props.updateContext`, and an `updateInput` prop, which is set to `props.updateInput`. The `PanelCard` component renders a card with a table of projects for the selected entity.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It returns a new expression node with the original variable name replaced by the new variable name, as well as a new frame object with the new variable name added. This hook can be used to create a copy of an existing variable with a new name.\n\nThe `useNewPanelFromRootQueryCallback` hook creates a new panel from a root query. It takes a panel name, a root query, a boolean indicating whether the panel should use a dashboard layout, and an optional callback function as input. It returns a function that can be used to create a new panel. This hook can be used to create a new panel from scratch.\n\nThe `useNewDashFromItems` hook creates a new dashboard from a set of child panels. It takes a panel name, a set of child panel configurations, a set of variables, and an optional callback function as input. It returns a function that can be used to create a new dashboard. This hook can be used to create a new dashboard from a set of child panels.\n\nThe `opStringConcat` function concatenates a set of strings or expression nodes into a single string.

The `input` object is a list of items to be displayed, the `child` object is the child component to be rendered for each item in the list, and the `config` object contains configuration options for the component. \n\nThe `PanelRow` component first filters out any null values from the `input` list if the `filterEmpty` option is set to true. It then uses the `pageSize` option to display a certain number of items per page, and allows the user to navigate between pages using the `PageControls` component.

These dependencies provide utility functions for working with data structures, UI components for building the dashboard, and styling components for the UI.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useConfig` hook and how is it used?\n- The `useConfig` hook is used to generate a configuration object for the `PanelRow` component based on its input type and child configuration. It takes in the input type, child configuration, and any props configuration as arguments, and returns a memoized configuration object. This configuration object is used to determine the page size, filtering options, and child configuration for the `PanelRow` component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelRow.md"}}],["779",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelRun.tsx)\n\nThe `PanelRun` component is a React functional component that renders a panel for displaying the output and logs of a running process. The component receives a `PanelRunProps` object as a prop, which contains a `panelConfig` object and an `input` object of type `run-type`. The `input` object is used to retrieve the output of the running process and display it in the panel.\n\nThe component first initializes a `consoleRef` reference to a `div` element, which is used to scroll to the bottom of the log output when new logs are added. It also initializes a `tab` state variable to keep track of which tab (log or output) is currently active.\n\nThe component then retrieves the `runQuery` object from the `input` prop using the `useValue` hook from the `hookUtils` module. The `useGatedValue` hook is used to prevent the component from rendering until the `runQuery` object is no longer loading. The `refresh` function is also retrieved from the `runQuery` object and is used to refresh the output of the running process.\n\nThe `outputNode` variable is then initialized using the `callOpVeryUnsafe` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. This function calls the `run-output` operation with the `self` parameter set to the `input` object. The `type` property of the resulting object is then set to the `_output` property of the `input` object. If the `runQuery` object is still loading or the state of the running process is `running`, the `voidNode` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module is returned instead.\n\nThe `usePanelStacksForType` hook is then used to retrieve the `handler` function for the output type of the running process. This function is used to render the output of the running process in a panel.\n\nThe `onScroll` function is defined to scroll to the bottom of the log output when new logs are added. The `useEffect` hook is used to set up a polling interval to refresh the output of the running process every 5 seconds. If the `runQuery` object is still loading or the state of the running process is `finished`, the polling interval is cleared.\n\nFinally, the component renders the panel with two tabs: log and output. The `consoleRef` is used to render the log output in the log tab, and the `handler` function is used to render the output of the running process in the output tab. The `updateConfig` function is also passed down to the `PanelComp2` component to allow the user to update the panel configuration.\n\nThe `Spec` object exports the `PanelRun` component as a `PanelSpec` object with an `id` of `run` and an `inputType` of `run-type`. This allows the component to be registered as a panel in the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `updateChoicesExpr` function?\n- The `updateChoicesExpr` function is used to update the `choices` property in the configuration object passed to the `PanelSelectEditor` component. It takes a new expression as an argument and updates the `choices` property in the current configuration object with it.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelSelectEditor.md"}}],["787",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelSimpleTable.tsx)\n\nThe `PanelSimpleTable` component is a React functional component that renders a table based on the input data and configuration. It is used to display data in a tabular format with sorting, filtering, and pagination capabilities. The component receives the input data and configuration as props and uses them to generate the table.\n\nThe component imports several modules from the `@wandb/weave` and `semantic-ui-react` libraries, as well as some custom modules from the project. It also defines a `PanelTable` type that specifies the input and state types for the component.\n\nThe `useWeaveContext` hook is used to get the `weave` object, which is an instance of the Weave client. The `input` and `config` props are used to generate the table rows and columns, respectively. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the rows and columns to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\nThe `PanelSimpleTable` component renders a `semantic-ui-react` `Table` component with the rows and columns generated from the input and configuration. The rows are generated by applying the filtering, grouping, and sorting functions specified in the configuration to the input data. The columns are generated by applying the column selection functions specified in the configuration to the rows.\n\nThe `PanelSimpleTable` component also supports pagination by using the `useEach` hook to render a subset of the rows based on the current page and page size specified in the configuration. The `useGatedValue` hook is used to prevent rendering the table until the rows are loaded.\n\nFinally, the `PanelSimpleTable` component exports a `Spec` object that specifies the `id`, `Component`, and `inputType` for the component. This object is used by other parts of the project to register the component and use it in the UI.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { Spec as SimpleTableSpec } from './PanelSimpleTable';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const input = [{ name: 'Alice', age: 30 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 40 }];\n  const config = { columns: { name: {}, age: {} } };\n  return <SimpleTableSpec.Component input={input} config={config} />;\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes in a `PanelSliderProps` object as a prop, which contains a `config` object with `min`, `max`, and `step` properties. If `config` is not provided, default values are used. The component renders three `WeaveExpression` components, each with a label and an input field. The `WeaveExpression` component is a custom input field that allows the user to enter an expression that evaluates to a number. When the user enters an expression, the component checks if the expression is assignable to a number. If it is, the expression is updated in the `config` object and passed up to the parent component via the `updateConfig` function.\n\n`PanelSlider` is a React functional component that renders a slider input. It takes in a `PanelSliderProps` object as a prop, which contains an `input` object that represents the value of the slider. The component also uses the `config` object to set the `min`, `max`, and `step` properties of the slider. The current value of the slider is obtained from the `valueQuery` object, which is created using the `useNodeValue` hook. When the user moves the slider, the `updateVal` function is called, which updates the value of the `input` object using the `setVal` function.\n\n`Spec` is an object that contains metadata about the slider component. It has an `id` property that identifies the component, a `ConfigComponent` property that points to the `PanelSliderConfig2` component, a `Component` property that points to the `PanelSlider` component, an `inputType` property that specifies the type of input expected by the component, and a `hidden` property that determines whether the component is visible in the UI.\n\nThese components can be used in the larger `weave` project to create custom UI components that allow the user to interact with data in a more intuitive way. For example, a data visualization component might use the slider component to allow the user to adjust the range of values displayed in the visualization. The configuration panel component can be used to allow the user to customize the behavior of the slider component.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `PanelSlider` component?\n- The `PanelSlider` component is a React functional component that renders a slider input with configurable minimum, maximum, and step values, and updates a Weave expression node with the selected value.\n\n2. What is the difference between `PanelSlider` and `PanelSliderConfig2`?\n- `PanelSlider` is the main component that renders the slider input and updates the Weave expression node, while `PanelSliderConfig2` is a configuration component that renders the minimum, maximum, and step options for the slider input.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useConfig` hook?\n- The `useConfig` hook is a custom hook that returns a memoized configuration object for the `PanelSliderConfig2` component, with default values for the minimum, maximum, and step options if no configuration is provided.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelSlider.md"}}],["789",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelString.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports three React components: `PanelStringConfig`, `PanelString`, and `Spec`. The purpose of these components is to display a string value in different modes: plaintext, markdown, or diff. \n\nThe `PanelStringConfig` component is a form that allows the user to select the display mode and, if the diff mode is selected, to enter a string to compare against. The `PanelString` component displays the string value in the selected mode. If the plaintext mode is selected and the string value is a URL, the component displays the URL as a hyperlink. The `Spec` object defines the properties of the `PanelString` component, including its ID, input type, and configuration component.\n\nThe `PanelString` component uses the `useWeaveContext` hook to access the Weave context, which provides information about the current state of the Weave application. The component also uses the `opArray` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module to create an array node that contains the input value and the comparand value (if the diff mode is selected). The component then uses the `CGReact.useNodeValue` hook to get the values of the array node. \n\nIf the markdown mode is selected, the component uses the `Markdown` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/Markdown` module to render the string value as markdown. If the diff mode is selected, the component uses the `diffChars`, `diffWords`, or `diffLines` function from the `diff` module to compare the string value to the comparand value and highlight the differences. If the plaintext mode is selected, the component uses the `PreformattedProportionalString` or `PreformattedMonoString` component from the `./PanelString.styles` module to display the string value as plaintext.\n\nIf the string value is a URL and the plaintext mode is selected, the component uses the `isURL` function to check if the string value is a valid URL. If the string value is a URL, the component displays the URL as a hyperlink using the `TargetBlank` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/util/links` module. If the string value is not a URL, the component displays the string value in the selected mode.\n\nOverall, the `PanelStringConfig`, `PanelString`, and `Spec` components provide a flexible and customizable way to display string values in different modes in the Weave application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` module and how is it being used in this code?\n- The `weave` module is being used to import various utility functions and types that are used throughout the code, such as `Node` and `opArray`. Its purpose is likely to provide a common set of functionality across different parts of the project.\n\n2. What is the `PanelString` component responsible for and how does it work?\n- The `PanelString` component is responsible for rendering a string input in different modes (plaintext, markdown, or diff) depending on the configuration passed in as props. It uses the `fullStr` and `comparandStr` variables to determine the content to display, and conditionally renders different elements based on the `mode` property of the configuration.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `TooltipTrigger` component and how is it used in this code?\n- The `TooltipTrigger` component is used to wrap the content being displayed in the `PanelString` component, providing a tooltip that displays additional information when the user hovers over the content. It is used to display the full string content when it is too long to fit in the available space, and to provide a copyable version of the content.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelString.md"}}],["790",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelString.styles.ts)\n\nThis code defines several styled components that are used in the weave project.

It has several properties that control its appearance, such as padding, width, and height. It also has properties that control how the strings are displayed, such as text alignment and scrollbars. This component is used to display strings in various parts of the weave project.\n\nThe `StringItem` component is a container for individual strings that are displayed within the `StringContainer`. It has properties that control its appearance, such as margin and max-height. This component is used to display individual strings within the `StringContainer`.\n\nThe `ConfigExpressionWrap` component is a container for configuration expressions that are displayed on the screen. It has properties that control its appearance, such as padding and background color. This component is used to display configuration expressions in various parts of the weave project.\n\nThe `PreformattedProportionalString` component is a preformatted string that is displayed on the screen. It has properties that control its appearance, such as font family and line height. This component is used to display preformatted strings in various parts of the weave project.\n\nThe `PreformattedMonoString` component is similar to `PreformattedProportionalString`, but it uses a monospace font instead of a proportional font. This component is used to display preformatted strings that require a fixed-width font.\n\nThe `TooltipMarkdownTip` component is a tooltip that is displayed on the screen. It has properties that control its appearance, such as padding and border. This component is used to display tooltips in various parts of the weave project.\n\nOverall, these components provide a consistent and flexible way to display strings, configuration expressions, and tooltips in the weave project. They can be used in various parts of the project to create a cohesive user interface. For example, the `StringContainer` and `StringItem` components might be used to display log messages, while the `ConfigExpressionWrap` component might be used to display configuration options.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the significance of the `globals` import and how is it used in this code?\n- The `globals` import is used to set the font family for one of the styled components, but it's unclear what other global styles it may define or how they are used in the project.\n\n3. Why are scrollbars hidden in the `StringContainer` component and how does this affect the user experience?\n- The scrollbars are hidden using CSS, but it's unclear why this design decision was made and how it affects the user experience when viewing long strings in the `StringContainer`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelString.styles.md"}}],["791",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelStringCompare.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a file that exports a React component called `PanelStringCompare`. This component is used to display a string comparison panel. The component takes in a set of props that are defined by the `PanelProps` type, which is generated based on the `inputType` object. The `inputType` object defines the expected input for the component, which is a union of two types: a dictionary object and a list object. Both types have an `objectType` property that is a union of two types: `string` and `none`. The list type also has a `maxLength` property that is set to 25.\n\nThe `PanelStringCompare` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to retrieve the value of the input. The retrieved value is then processed to generate a list of key-value pairs, which are displayed in a container. The component also includes a tooltip that displays the key-value pairs in a preformatted string. If the input is empty, the component displays a dash.\n\nThe `PanelStringCompare` component is exported as part of a `PanelSpec` object, which includes an `id` property set to `'string-compare'`, and a `Component` property set to `PanelStringCompare`.

Otherwise, it renders an `EditableField` component with the `fullStr` value as the initial value and the `updateVal` function as the save callback. The `multiline` property is used to determine whether the `EditableField` should be a single-line or multi-line input field.\n\nThe code also exports a `Spec` object that defines the properties of the `PanelStringEditor` component. The `hidden` property is a boolean that indicates whether the component should be hidden by default. The `id` property is a string that identifies the component.

Once the component is visible, it renders the `PanelStringHistogramInner` component, which is responsible for rendering the actual histogram.\n\nThe `PanelStringHistogramInner` component takes in the same set of props as the `PanelStringHistogram` component, as well as the `height` and `width` of the container. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the histogram specification and the input data. The histogram specification is generated using the `makeHistoSpec` and `makeHistoSpecColored` functions, which define the Vega specification for the histogram. The input data is generated by querying the input node using the `useNodeValue` hook from the `hookUtils` module. If the input node is colorable, the `useColorNode` hook is used to query the color node.

Its main functionalities include displaying the column name, allowing users to edit the column name and cell expression, managing column settings such as grouping, sorting, inserting, pinning, and removing columns, and rendering the appropriate panel for the selected node.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `ColumnHeader` component handle column sorting and what are the different sorting states?\n   **Answer**: The `ColumnHeader` component handles column sorting using the `SortStateToggle` sub-component and the `makeSortingMenuItems` function. The different sorting states are 'asc' (ascending), 'desc' (descending), and 'undefined' (no sorting). Users can toggle between these states by clicking on the appropriate control icons or selecting options from the column menu.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `ColumnHeader` component manage the panel settings and configuration for the selected node?\n   **Answer**: The `ColumnHeader` component manages the panel settings and configuration for the selected node using the `PanelContextProvider` and the `PanelComp2` components. It passes the necessary input, input type, panel specification, and configuration to the `PanelComp2` component, which renders the appropriate panel for the selected node. The component also provides functions to update the panel configuration and context.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnHeader.md"}}],["797",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelector.tsx)\n\nThe `ColumnSelector` component is a React functional component that provides a UI for selecting and displaying columns in a table. It is part of the larger `weave` project and is used to manage the state of the table columns. \n\nThe component imports several modules from the `weave` project, including `LegacyWBIcon`, `dynamicMatchWithMapping`, `Node`, and `useWeaveContext`. It also imports several modules from external libraries, including `React`, `lodash`, and `semantic-ui-react`. \n\nThe `ColumnSelector` component takes three props: `inputNode`, `tableState`, and `update`. `inputNode` is an object that represents the input data for the table. `tableState` is an object that represents the current state of the table, including the order of the columns and the columns themselves. `update` is a function that updates the state of the table. \n\nThe component renders a UI that allows the user to select and display columns in the table. The UI consists of two lists: one for available columns and one for displayed columns. The user can drag and drop columns between the two lists to add or remove them from the table. The UI also includes a search bar that allows the user to search for columns by name. \n\nThe `ColumnSelector` component uses several hooks to manage its state. It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the `draggingColumn` and `visibleColumnListEl` variables. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `defaultTable`, `colNameMap`, `allColumnNames`, `searchedColumnsAvailable`, and `searchedColumnsUsed` variables. It uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `resetDraggingState`, `updateConfig`, `dropField`, `onContainerDrop`, `addColumn`, `removeColumn`, `addAll`, `removeAll`, and `getSearchMatches` functions. \n\nOverall, the `ColumnSelector` component provides a flexible and user-friendly way to manage the state of table columns in the `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `ColumnSelector` that allows users to select and display columns in a table.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from external libraries such as `@wandb/weave`, `lodash`, and `semantic-ui-react`.\n\n3. What are some of the key features or functionalities of this code?\n- Some key features of this code include the ability to search for and select columns from a list of available columns, drag and drop columns to add or remove them from the displayed columns, and limit the number of columns shown to improve responsiveness.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelector.md"}}],["798",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelector.styles.ts)\n\nThe code above is a styled component that creates a search input field with a specific style. It imports the `Input` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library and the `styled` function from the `styled-components` library. \n\nThe `ColumnSearchInput` component is created by calling the `styled` function with the `Input` component as an argument. This creates a new component that inherits all the properties of the `Input` component and can be styled using CSS. \n\nThe CSS styles applied to the `ColumnSearchInput` component include setting the width to 100% and adding a left margin of 5 pixels. The `& > input` selector targets the input element inside the `ColumnSearchInput` component and applies additional styles to it. These styles remove the border, border-radius, and add a bottom border with a light gray color. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a reusable search input field with a consistent style. For example, it can be used in a table component to allow users to search for specific data within a column. \n\nHere is an example of how the `ColumnSearchInput` component can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Table, Input } from 'semantic-ui-react';\nimport { ColumnSearchInput } from './weave';\n\nconst data = [\n  { name: 'John', age: 25 },\n  { name: 'Jane', age: 30 },\n  { name: 'Bob', age: 40 },\n];\n\nconst TableExample = () => {\n  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = React.useState('');\n\n  const handleSearchChange = (event) => {\n    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);\n  };\n\n  const filteredData = data.filter((item) =>\n    item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <Table>\n      <Table.Header>\n        <Table.Row>\n          <Table.HeaderCell>Name</Table.HeaderCell>\n          <Table.HeaderCell>Age</Table.HeaderCell>\n        </Table.Row>\n      </Table.Header>\n      <Table.Body>\n        <Table.Row>\n          <Table.Cell>\n            <ColumnSearchInput\n              placeholder=\"Search name\"\n              value={searchTerm}\n              onChange={handleSearchChange}\n            />\n          </Table.Cell>\n          <Table.Cell></Table.Cell>\n        </Table.Row>\n        {filteredData.map((item) => (\n          <Table.Row key={item.name}>\n            <Table.Cell>{item.name}</Table.Cell>\n            <Table.Cell>{item.age}</Table.Cell>\n          </Table.Row>\n        ))}\n      </Table.Body>\n    </Table>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default TableExample;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ColumnSearchInput` component is used as a search input field for the `name` column in a table. The `value` and `onChange` props are used to control the input field and filter the data based on the search term.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `semantic-ui-react` library and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `semantic-ui-react` library is used to import the `Input` component, which is then styled using `styled-components`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `ColumnSearchInput` component and how is it used in the project?\n   - The `ColumnSearchInput` component is a styled version of the `Input` component that is used for searching within a column. It can be used in any part of the project where a search input is needed within a column.\n\n3. What is the significance of the CSS properties applied to the `input` element within the `ColumnSearchInput` component?\n   - The CSS properties remove the border and border-radius of the input element, while adding a bottom border to create a consistent look with other search inputs in the project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelector.styles.md"}}],["799",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelectorField.tsx)\n\nThe `ColumnSelectorField` component is a React functional component that renders a single column field in a table editor. It receives several props that define its behavior and appearance, including whether it is disabled, the name and ID of the column it represents, an icon to display, and a search query and mode for highlighting matches. \n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to keep track of how many times it has been dragged over by another component. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the component's HTML element, which can be used to access its properties and methods. \n\nThe `ColumnSelectorField` component renders a `List.Item` element that contains a `div` element with the class `column-field`. The `div` element contains an `Icon` component and a `span` element that displays the column name. The `Icon` component displays an icon based on the `icon` prop, or a default \"metadata\" icon if no icon is specified. The `span` element uses the `dynamicMatchHighlight` function from the `columnMatching` module to highlight any matches between the column name and the search query. \n\nThe `ColumnSelectorField` component also includes several event handlers that are used to handle drag-and-drop interactions. When the component is dragged over by another component, the `onDragEnter` handler increments the `draggingOver` state variable. When the component is dragged away, the `onDragLeave` handler decrements the `draggingOver` state variable. When the component is dropped onto another component, the `onDrop` handler sets the `draggingOver` state variable to 0 and calls the `onDrop` prop function with an object containing the name and ID of the column. \n\nOverall, the `ColumnSelectorField` component is a reusable building block that can be used to create a table editor interface. It provides a way to display and interact with individual columns in a table, and includes support for drag-and-drop interactions and search highlighting. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport ColumnSelectorField from './ColumnSelectorField';\n\nfunction MyTableEditor(props) {\n  const columns = [\n    {name: 'Column 1', id: 'col1', icon: 'chart'},\n    {name: 'Column 2', id: 'col2', icon: 'table'},\n    {name: 'Column 3', id: 'col3', icon: 'metadata'},\n  ];\n\n  function handleColumnDrop(column) {\n    console.log(`Dropped column ${column.name} with ID ${column.id}`);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"table-editor\">\n      <List>\n        {columns.map(column => (\n          <ColumnSelectorField\n            key={column.id}\n            colName={column.name}\n            colId={column.id}\n            icon={column.icon}\n            onDrop={handleColumnDrop}\n          />\n        ))}\n      </List>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `ColumnSelectorField` component and what are its props?\n- The `ColumnSelectorField` component is a React functional component that renders a list item with a column name and an icon. Its props include `disabled`, `colName`, `colId`, `icon`, `config`, `dragging`, `searchQuery`, `searchMode`, `onDragStart`, `onDragEnd`, `onClick`, and `onDrop`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `dynamicMatchHighlight` function and where is it defined?\n- The `dynamicMatchHighlight` function is used to highlight a search query within a column name based on a given search mode. It is defined in a separate file located at `@wandb/weave/common/util/columnMatching`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelectorField.md"}}],["800",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelectorListContainer.tsx)\n\nThe `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component is a React functional component that renders a container for a list of columns. It takes in two props: `onDrop` and `visibleColumns`. `onDrop` is a function that is called when a drag-and-drop operation is completed on the container. `visibleColumns` is a boolean value that determines whether the container is visible or hidden.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `dragover` state, which is a boolean value that determines whether the container is currently being dragged over. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the container's DOM element.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with the `column-list-container` class. The class is conditionally modified based on the `dragover` and `visibleColumns` states. When the container is being dragged over, the `dragover` state is set to `true`, and the `dragover` class is added to the container. When the container is visible, the `visible-container` class is added, and when it is hidden, the `hidden-container` class is added.\n\nThe component also sets up event listeners for drag-and-drop events. When the container is dragged over, the `onDragStart` and `onDragEnter` events are triggered, and the `dragover` state is set to `true`. When the container is dragged out, the `onDragLeave` event is triggered, and the `dragover` state is set to `false`. The `onDragOver` event is necessary for the `onDrop` event to work, and it prevents the default behavior of the browser. When an item is dropped onto the container, the `onDrop` event is triggered, and the `onDrop` function is called. The function checks whether the item was dropped directly onto the container or one of its children and calls the `onDrop` function only if it was dropped directly onto the container.\n\nThe `ColumnSelectorListContainer` component is exported as the default export of the `weave` module. It can be used in other components to render a container for a list of columns that can be dragged and dropped. For example:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ColumnSelectorListContainer from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const handleDrop = () => {\n    console.log('Item dropped!');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ColumnSelectorListContainer onDrop={handleDrop} visibleColumns={true}>\n      <div>Column 1</div>\n      <div>Column 2</div>\n      <div>Column 3</div>\n    </ColumnSelectorListContainer>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `useRef` and `useState` hooks used in this component?\n- The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the `div` element rendered by the component, which is used to check whether a drag and drop event is dropped on the container or one of its children. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `dragover` variable, which is used to determine whether the container is currently being dragged over.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/ColumnSelectorListContainer.md"}}],["801",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/actions.ts)\n\nThe `TableActions` function in the `weave` project is responsible for generating an array of actions that can be performed on a table. The function takes in three arguments: `weave`, `filterFn`, and `setFilterFn`. `weave` is an object that provides an interface to the `weave` library, `filterFn` is a function that filters the table, and `setFilterFn` is a function that sets the filter.\n\nThe function returns an array of two objects, each representing an action that can be performed on the table. The first action is \"Filter: Only this value\", which filters the table to show only rows that match a specific value. The second action is \"Filter: Exclude this value\", which filters the table to exclude rows that match a specific value.\n\nBoth actions have a `name`, `icon`, `detail`, `isAvailable`, and `doAction` property. The `name` and `icon` properties are self-explanatory. The `detail` property is a function that returns a string that describes the action being performed. The `isAvailable` property is a function that determines whether the action is available for a given node. The `doAction` property is a function that performs the action.\n\nThe `isFilterableNode` function is used to determine whether a node is filterable. A node is filterable if its type is assignable to `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. The `detail` function uses the `weave` library to query the value of a node and returns a string that describes the action being performed. The `doAction` function uses the `weave` library to query the value of a node and sets the filter function accordingly.\n\nOverall, the `TableActions` function provides a way to filter a table based on specific values. This can be useful for exploring large datasets and finding patterns in the data. Here is an example of how the `TableActions` function can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Weave } from '@wandb/weave';\nimport { TableActions } from 'weave';\n\nconst weave = new Weave();\nconst filterFn = null;\nconst setFilterFn = (filter) => {\n  console.log(filter);\n};\n\nconst actions = TableActions(weave, filterFn, setFilterFn);\nconsole.log(actions);\n```\n\nThis will output an array of two objects representing the \"Filter: Only this value\" and \"Filter: Exclude this value\" actions.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports an array of two objects that define actions for filtering table data in a Weave interface.\n\n2.

What are the inputs and outputs of the `TableActions` function?\n- The `TableActions` function takes in three parameters: a `WeaveInterface` object, a `NodeOrVoidNode` filter function, and a function to set the filter function. It returns an array of two `NodeAction` objects that define the behavior of the filter actions.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/actions.md"}}],["802",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/baseTable.css)\n\nThe code in this file defines custom CSS styles for a component called PanelTable, which is built on top of the `react-base-table` library. The purpose of this file is to override some of the default styling provided by `react-base-table` and provide a more customized look and feel for the PanelTable component.\n\nThe code defines several CSS classes and rules that target specific elements within the PanelTable component. For example, the `.BaseTable__header` class is used to style the table header, while the `.BaseTable__row` class is used to style individual rows in the table. The code also defines styles for the column resizer, table footer, and frozen rows.\n\nOne notable feature of the code is the use of the `:hover` pseudo-class to change the appearance of certain elements when the user hovers over them. For example, when the user hovers over the table header, the column resizer becomes visible. When the user hovers over a row, the background color changes to a light blue.\n\nTo use these custom styles, the code must be imported into the PanelTable component after the `react-base-table` styles have been imported. This is done in the `PanelTable.tsx` file using the following code:\n\n```\nimport BaseTable, {BaseTableProps} from 'react-base-table';\nimport 'react-base-table/styles.css';\nimport './baseTable.css';\n```\n\nOverall, this file plays an important role in customizing the appearance of the PanelTable component and ensuring that it fits seamlessly into the larger project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This is useful for creating dynamic and responsive data visualizations. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const [tableState, setTableState] = useState(initialTableState);\n\n  const refinedTableState = useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions(\n    tableState,\n    inputNode,\n    stack,\n    weave\n  );\n\n  // use refinedTableState to render data visualization\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `refineTableStateExpressions` function?\n- The `refineTableStateExpressions` function refines all table state expressions when their input variable values change, and returns a new table state.\n\n2. What is the difference between `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` and `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions`?\n- `useTableStateWithRefinedExpressions` is a hook that makes the `refineTableStateExpressions` function usable as a promise, while `useTableStatesWithRefinedExpressions` is a vectorized version of the same function that can handle multiple table states at once.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `refineExpressions` and `vectorizePromiseFn` functions?\n- The `refineExpressions` function refines a list of expressions using a stack and a WeaveInterface, while `vectorizePromiseFn` is a utility function that vectorizes a promise-returning function so that it can handle multiple inputs at once.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/tableStateReact.md"}}],["806",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTable/tableType.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a module that provides functionality for normalizing and working with different types of tables. The module exports several constants and functions that can be used to convert different types of tables to a common format.\n\nThe `GeneralTableType` constant represents a table with any object type, while the `DataTableType` constant represents a table with a typed dictionary object type. The `ConvertibleToDataTableType` constant represents a union of different types that can be converted to a data table, including files that contain tables, partitioned tables, and joined tables. The `GeneralTableLikeType` and `DataTableLikeType` constants represent unions of different types that are similar to the `GeneralTableType` and `DataTableType` constants, respectively, but also include types that can be converted to those types.\n\nThe `normalizeTableLike` function takes a `Node` object as input and returns a normalized version of the input that conforms to the common table format. The function first extracts the type of the input node and checks if it is a list-like type. If so, it extracts the object type of the list. The function then checks if the type is a file that contains a table, partitioned table, or joined table. If so, it applies the appropriate operation to the file to extract the table data. If the type is a table, partitioned table, or joined table, the function returns the input node. If the type is not recognized, the function returns the input node unchanged.\n\nThe `isTableTypeLike` function takes a `Type` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the type is a table, partitioned table, or joined table, or a file that contains one of those types. The function works similarly to the `normalizeTableLike` function, but does not perform any normalization and only returns a boolean value.\n\nOverall, this module provides useful functionality for working with different types of tables in a consistent way, allowing users to easily convert between different table types and perform operations on tables regardless of their original format.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and what does this file contribute to it?\n- The purpose of the `weave` project is not clear from this code alone. This file contains functions and constants related to table-like data types and their normalization.\n\n2. What are the different types of table-like data that can be normalized using the `normalizeTableLike` function?\n- The different types of table-like data that can be normalized using the `normalizeTableLike` function are: regular tables, partitioned tables, and joined tables. These can be in the form of either a direct node or a file with a corresponding table-like object type.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isTableTypeLike` function and what types of data can it identify?\n- The purpose of the `isTableTypeLike` function is to determine if a given data type is a table-like type that can be normalized using the `normalizeTableLike` function.

The code provides a React component `PanelTableMergeConfig` that renders a configuration panel with options to select the method of combining tables (joining or concatenating), the style of joining (outer or inner), and the keys to be used for joining.\n\nThe code defines several utility functions and hooks to process the configuration, such as `getJoinKeys`, `useJoinKeys`, `getProcessedConfig`, `useProcessedConfig`, and `getAggregatedRowsNode`. These functions are used to determine the available join keys, process the configuration, and generate the final merged table based on the selected options.\n\nFor example, the `getJoinKeys` function takes an object type and an optional list of used keys, and returns an object containing all join keys, preferred join keys, and a map of joinable object paths.

The `PanelTextEditor` component is a text editor that uses the MonacoEditor component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/Monaco/Editor` module. The component takes in a `PanelStringEditorProps` object as a prop, which is defined as a `PanelProps` object with a specific `inputType`. The `inputType` object is a union type that contains a list of file extensions and their corresponding `wbObjectType`. \n\nWhen the `PanelTextEditor` component is rendered, it first creates a `contentsNode` object using the `opFileContents` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. This function takes in the `file` property from the `props.input` object and returns a node that represents the contents of the file. The `contentsNode` object is then used to create a `contentsValueQuery` object using the `useNodeValue` hook from the `../../react` module. This hook returns a query object that contains the result of the `contentsNode` object. The `contents` variable is then set to the `result` property of the `contentsValueQuery` object.\n\nThe `PanelTextEditor` component then creates a `updateVal` function using the `useMutation` hook from the `../../react` module. This function takes in the `contentsNode` object and a mutation type of `'string-set'`. The `nodeValueQuery` object is then created using the `useNodeValue` hook with the `props.input` object as its argument.

The component is part of a larger project called Weave, which is not described in this code snippet.\n\nThe component imports a Loader component from a package called `@wandb/weave/common/components/WandbLoader`, which is used to display a loading spinner while the trace viewer is being loaded. It also imports a function called `getConfig` from a file located in the `config` directory, which returns an object containing a `urlPrefixed` property. This property is used to prefix the URL of the trace viewer with a base URL, which is defined elsewhere in the project.\n\nThe component defines a type called `inputType`, which is an object with a `type` property set to `'union'` and a `members` property set to an array of two objects. Each object represents a file type that the component can render. The first object has a `type` property set to `'file'` and an `extension` property set to `'trace'`. The second object has a `type` property set to `'file'` and an `extension` property set to `'trace.json'`.\n\nThe component also defines a type called `PanelTraceProps`, which is a generic type that extends the `PanelProps` type from a file called `panel`. The `PanelProps` type takes a type argument that is passed to the `inputType` property of the `Spec` object defined at the bottom of the file. The `PanelTraceProps` type is used to define the props that are passed to the `PanelTrace` component.\n\nThe `PanelTrace` component takes a single prop called `props`, which is an object that contains an `input` property. The `input` property is an object that represents the file that the component will render. The component uses a custom hook called `useSignedUrlWithExpiration` to get a signed URL for the file, which is used to load the trace viewer in the iframe. The `useSignedUrlWithExpiration` hook takes two arguments: the file object and a number representing the expiration time of the signed URL in milliseconds.\n\nIf the signed URL is null, the component returns the `Loader` component to display a loading spinner. Otherwise, the component renders an iframe with a `title` property set to `'Trace viewer'` and a `src` property that is constructed using the `urlPrefixed` function from the `getConfig` function. The `src` property contains two query parameters: `url`, which is set to the signed URL, and `identifier`, which is set to the name of the file.\n\nFinally, the component exports a `Spec` object, which is an object with three properties: `id`, which is set to `'tracer'`, `Component`, which is set to the `PanelTrace` component, and `inputType`, which is set to the `inputType` object defined earlier in the file.

The component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `react` module to get the value of the `input` object. If the value is still loading, the component returns a `Loader` component from the `semantic-ui-react` module. If the value is `null`, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, the component parses the value as a JSON object and renders it using the `GeneralObjectRenderer` component.\n\nThe `GeneralObjectRenderer` component is a recursive component that takes in a `data` object as a prop and renders it based on its type. If the `data` object is `null`, the component returns a `-` string. If it is a string, the component renders it as a `ConstrainedTextField` component from the `lct.style` module, which is a styled `div` element with a tooltip that displays the full string when hovered over. If it is a number or boolean, the component simply renders it as a `div` element. If it is an array, the component maps over each item in the array and recursively renders it using `GeneralObjectRenderer`. If it is an object, the component first checks if it is a `ModelComponent` object by checking if it has an `_kind` property. If it is, the component renders a header row with an icon and the `_kind` property as text. The component then filters the object's entries to remove any keys that start with `_` or are `'verbose'`, and sorts them alphabetically. It then splits the entries into two arrays: `collapsibleEntries` and `nonCollapsibleEntries`. `collapsibleEntries` contains entries that should be collapsible, such as objects and arrays, while `nonCollapsibleEntries` contains entries that should always be visible, such as strings, numbers, and booleans. The component then renders a `KeyValTable` component for these two arrays of entries.\n\nThe `KeyValTable` component is a styled table that takes in an `isArray` boolean prop, a `header` prop, a `collapsibleContent` prop, and a `nonCollapsibleContent` prop. If `collapsibleContent` is not empty and `header` is not `null`, the component renders a collapsible header row with a collapse button. The component then renders the contents of `collapsibleContent` and `nonCollapsibleContent` as separate rows using the `KVTContents` component.\n\nThe `KVTContents` component is a helper component that takes in an `isArrayItem` boolean prop and a `contents` prop, which is an array of objects with `key` and `valueContent` properties.

It is part of the larger `weave` project and is imported from various modules. The component takes in an input of type `list` that contains objects of type `wb_trace_tree` or `none`. The component then sorts the input list by the start time of each trace tree and creates a table view of the sorted list. The table view contains columns for Success, Timestamp, Input, Output, Chain, Error, and Model ID. The Success column indicates whether the trace tree was successful or not. The Timestamp column displays the timestamp of the trace tree. The Input, Output, and Chain columns display the formatted input, output, and chain of the trace tree, respectively. The Error column displays the error message if the trace tree was unsuccessful. The Model ID column displays the ID of the model associated with the trace tree.\n\nThe `PanelTraceTreeTraceTableViewer` component uses various helper functions to create the table view. The `makeTableState` function takes in an input array node and a `weave` object and returns an object containing the table state and column widths. The `addNamedColumnToTable` function adds a named column to the table state. The `enableSortByCol` function enables sorting of the table by a specified column. The `getRowExampleNode` function returns an example node for a row of the table. The `opPick` function returns a new object with only the specified key-value pair. The `opNumberToTimestamp` function converts a number to a timestamp. The `opWBTraceTreeStartTime` function returns the start time of a trace tree. The `opWBTraceTreeSummary` function returns a summary of the trace trees.\n\nThe `PanelTraceTreeTraceTableViewer` component also uses various hooks to manage state. The `useCallback` hook memoizes the `updateTableConfigWrapper` function. The `useEffect` hook updates the table view when the number of rows changes. The `useMemo` hook memoizes the `makeTableState` function. The `useState` hook manages the selected index and selected tab state.\n\nThe `PanelTraceTreeTraceTableViewer` component is exported along with a `Spec` object that contains metadata about the component.

These constants are used to maintain a consistent color scheme throughout the project. \n\nThe code also defines a React functional component called `MinimalTooltip`. This component takes in a `text` prop, which is a string that represents the content to be displayed in the tooltip. The `lengthLimit` prop is an optional number that specifies the maximum length of the `text` prop. If the length of the `text` prop is less than the `lengthLimit`, the `MinimalTooltip` component simply renders its children. If the length of the `text` prop is greater than or equal to the `lengthLimit`, the `MinimalTooltip` component renders a `TooltipTrigger` component from the `../Tooltip` module. The `TooltipTrigger` component displays a tooltip with the `text` prop as its content. The `copyableContent` prop of the `TooltipTrigger` component is set to the `text` prop, which allows the user to copy the content of the tooltip. The `content` prop of the `TooltipTrigger` component is set to a `pre` element that contains the `text` prop, which formats the content of the tooltip as preformatted text.\n\nThis `MinimalTooltip` component can be used throughout the larger project to provide tooltips for various UI elements. For example, if there is a button that performs a certain action, the `MinimalTooltip` component can be used to provide a tooltip that explains what the button does. The `lengthLimit` prop can be used to ensure that the tooltip does not become too long and difficult to read. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport {MinimalTooltip} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <MinimalTooltip text=\"Click this button to perform the action\">\n        Perform Action\n      </MinimalTooltip>\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the `MinimalTooltip` component used for and how is it intended to be used?\n- The `MinimalTooltip` component is a React functional component that takes in children, text, and lengthLimit as props and conditionally renders either the children or a `TooltipTrigger` component with the text as copyable content and a preformatted version of the text as the tooltip content. It is intended to be used as a way to display tooltips with copyable content.\n\n3.

The purpose of this code is to provide a set of reusable UI components that can be used to build various parts of the Weave application. \n\nThe file imports several dependencies, including `@wandb/weave/common/css/globals.styles`, `semantic-ui-react`, and `styled-components`. The `globals.styles` file contains global CSS styles that are used throughout the Weave application. The `semantic-ui-react` library provides pre-built UI components that can be used to build complex interfaces. The `styled-components` library is used to create custom styled components that can be used in the Weave application.\n\nThe file exports several styled components, including `LCTDetailView`, `LCTTableSection`, `LCTWrapper`, `SimpleTabs`, `TabWrapper`, `ConstrainedTextField`, `ModelWrapper`, `ModelComponentHeader`, `KVTValue`, `KVTKey`, `KVTRow`, `KVTCollapseButton`, `KVTHeader`, `KVTWrapper`, `SpanElementChildSpanWrapper`, `SpanElementChildSpansWrapper`, `SpanElementHeader`, `SpanDetailTable`, `DurationLabel`, `SpanDetailHeader`, `SpanDetailWrapper`, `KVDetailValueText`, `KVDetailValueTD`, `KVDetailKeyTD`, `TraceDetailWrapper`, `TraceTimelineElementWrapper`, `TraceWrapper`, `TraceTimelineWrapper`, `TraceDetail`, `TraceTimeline`, `SpanDetailIOSectionHeaderTd`, and `SpanDetailSectionHeaderTd`.\n\nEach of these components is designed to be used in a specific part of the Weave application. For example, the `SimpleTabs` component is used to create a tabbed interface, while the `SpanElementHeader` component is used to display information about a specific span in a trace. \n\nDevelopers working on the Weave project can use these components to quickly build new UI elements without having to write custom CSS or HTML. For example, a developer could use the `SimpleTabs` component to create a tabbed interface for a new feature in the Weave application:\n\n```\nimport { SimpleTabs } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <SimpleTabs>\n      <Tab label=\"Tab 1\">\n        <p>Content for Tab 1</p>\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab label=\"Tab 2\">\n        <p>Content for Tab 2</p>\n      </Tab>\n    </SimpleTabs>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of reusable UI components that can be used to build various parts of the Weave application.

It is triggered by setting the `visible` prop to `true`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree/lct.style.md"}}],["817",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/.autodoc/docs/json/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree)\n\nThe `PanelTraceTree` folder in the `weave-js` project contains components and hooks for visualizing and interacting with trace trees. These components can be used to display JSON objects in a user-friendly way, such as in a debugging or testing context.\n\nFor example, the `PanelTraceTreeModel` component renders a JSON object in a visually appealing way. It takes in a `PanelTraceTreeModelProps` object as a prop, which contains an `input` object with a `type` property set to `'wb_trace_tree'`. The component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `react` module to get the value of the `input` object. If the value is still loading, the component returns a `Loader` component from the `semantic-ui-react` module. If the value is `null`, the component returns an empty `div`. Otherwise, the component parses the value as a JSON object and renders it using the `GeneralObjectRenderer` component.\n\n```jsx\nimport {PanelTraceTreeModel} from 'weave';\n\nconst myObject = {\n  name: 'John',\n  age: 30,\n  hobbies: ['reading', 'swimming', 'hiking'],\n  address: {\n    street: '123 Main St',\n    city: 'Anytown',\n    state: 'CA',\n    zip: '12345'\n  }\n};\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <PanelTraceTreeModel input={{type: 'wb_trace_tree', data: myObject}} />\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThe `PanelTraceTreeTraceTableViewer` component renders a table view of trace trees. It takes in an input of type `list` that contains objects of type `wb_trace_tree` or `none`. The component then sorts the input list by the start time of each trace tree and creates a table view of the sorted list. The table view contains columns for Success, Timestamp, Input, Output, Chain, Error, and Model ID.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Spec as TraceTreeSpec } from './weave';\n\n// Assuming `traceTreeData` is an object containing the trace tree data\nconst traceTreeInput = {\n  type: 'wb_trace_tree',\n  data: traceTreeData,\n};\n\n<TraceTreeSpec.Component input={traceTreeInput} />;\n```\n\nThe `common.tsx` file defines a set of constants for colors and text colors that are used in the larger project. It also defines a React functional component called `MinimalTooltip` that can be used to provide tooltips for various UI elements.\n\n```jsx\nimport {MinimalTooltip} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyButton() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <MinimalTooltip text=\"Click this button to perform the action\">\n        Perform Action\n      </MinimalTooltip>\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `lct.style.ts` file contains a collection of styled components that can be used to build various parts of the Weave application. Developers can use these components to quickly build new UI elements without having to write custom CSS or HTML.\n\n```jsx\nimport { SimpleTabs } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <SimpleTabs>\n      <Tab label=\"Tab 1\">\n        <p>Content for Tab 1</p>\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab label=\"Tab 2\">\n        <p>Content for Tab 2</p>\n      </Tab>\n    </SimpleTabs>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `tipOverlay.tsx` file provides a React hook that displays a tip overlay on the screen when a user interacts with a specific component.\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useTipOverlay } from './weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { tipOverlay, showTipOverlay } = useTipOverlay();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div onMouseEnter={showTipOverlay} onMouseLeave={showTipOverlay}>\n        {/* Component code */}\n      </div>\n      {tipOverlay}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThe `zoomAndPan.ts` file provides a hook for implementing zoom and pan functionality for a timeline in a React project.\n\n```jsx\nimport {useTimelineZoomAndPan} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyTimeline() {\n  const {timelineRef, timelineStyle, scale} = useTimelineZoomAndPan({});\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={timelineRef} style={timelineStyle}>\n      {/* Render timeline items here */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree/summary.md"}}],["818",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree/tipOverlay.tsx)\n\nThe code above is a React hook that provides a TipOverlayResult object with two properties: a ReactNode called tipOverlay and a function called showTipOverlay. The purpose of this hook is to display a tip overlay on the screen when a user interacts with a specific component. The tip overlay is a message that informs the user about how to use the component. In this case, the message is \"Click and drag to pan\".\n\nThe useTipOverlay hook uses the useState and useRef hooks from React to manage the state of the tip overlay. The useState hook initializes the tipOverlayShown state to false. The useRef hook creates a reference to a timeout ID that is used to hide the tip overlay after a certain amount of time.\n\nThe showTipOverlay function is a callback function that sets the tipOverlayShown state to true and creates a timeout using the window.setTimeout method. The timeout is set to 1000 milliseconds (1 second). When the timeout expires, the function checks if the current timeout ID matches the one stored in the hideTipOverlayTimeoutIDRef. If they match, the tipOverlayShown state is set to false, and the tip overlay is hidden.\n\nThe tipOverlay property of the TipOverlayResult object is a ReactNode that renders a styled component called TipOverlay from a separate file called lct.style. The visible prop of the TipOverlay component is set to the value of the tipOverlayShown state.\n\nThe showTipOverlay function is returned as part of the TipOverlayResult object. This function can be called by the component that uses the useTipOverlay hook to display the tip overlay.\n\nOverall, this hook provides an easy way to display a tip overlay for a specific component in a React application. It can be used to improve the user experience by providing helpful information about how to use a component. Here is an example of how to use the useTipOverlay hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useTipOverlay } from './weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { tipOverlay, showTipOverlay } = useTipOverlay();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <div onMouseEnter={showTipOverlay} onMouseLeave={showTipOverlay}>\n        {/* Component code */}\n      </div>\n      {tipOverlay}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `useTipOverlay` function?\n- The `useTipOverlay` function returns an object with a `tipOverlay` ReactNode and a `showTipOverlay` function. The `tipOverlay` is a component that displays a message and the `showTipOverlay` function sets the state to show the `tipOverlay`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `useCallback` hook in this code?\n- The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `showTipOverlay` function so that it is only recreated when its dependencies change. This can improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `hideTipOverlayTimeoutIDRef` variable?\n- The `hideTipOverlayTimeoutIDRef` variable is a reference to a timeout ID that is used to hide the `tipOverlay` after a certain amount of time has passed. It is stored in a ref so that it can be accessed and cleared if the `showTipOverlay` function is called again before the timeout has completed.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree/tipOverlay.md"}}],["819",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelTraceTree/zoomAndPan.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that provides functionality for zooming and panning a timeline. The file contains a React hook called `useTimelineZoomAndPan` that returns an object with three properties: `timelineRef`, `timelineStyle`, and `scale`. \n\nThe `timelineRef` property is a reference to the `div` element that contains the timeline. The `timelineStyle` property is an object that contains a single property, `userSelect`, which is set to `none`. This disables text selection on the timeline. The `scale` property is a number that represents the current zoom level of the timeline. \n\nThe `useTimelineZoomAndPan` hook takes an object with an optional `onHittingMinZoom` property as its argument. The `onHittingMinZoom` function is called when the user tries to zoom out beyond the minimum zoom level. \n\nThe hook uses several other hooks and functions to implement the zoom and pan functionality. The `useStateWithRef` hook is used to create a state variable for the zoom level that also has a reference to the current value. The `useTimelineCursor` function is used to create a cursor state variable that changes depending on whether the user is dragging the timeline or not. \n\nThe hook also contains several event listeners that are added to the timeline element. The `onWheel` function is called when the user scrolls the mouse wheel. It calculates the new zoom level based on the scroll delta and updates the `scale` state variable. It also calculates the new scroll position based on the mouse position and the new zoom level. The `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, and `onMouseMove` functions are called when the user clicks, releases, or moves the mouse, respectively. They are used to enable dragging of the timeline. \n\nFinally, the hook contains a second `useEffect` hook that is used to scroll the timeline to the correct position after a zoom operation. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful hook for implementing zoom and pan functionality for a timeline in a React project. Here is an example of how it might be used:\n\n```\nimport {useTimelineZoomAndPan} from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyTimeline() {\n  const {timelineRef, timelineStyle, scale} = useTimelineZoomAndPan({});\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={timelineRef} style={timelineStyle}>\n      {/* Render timeline items here */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

This object is defined using the `PanelProps` type from the `Panel2` module, which is imported at the top of the file. The `PanelType` component uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `CGReact` module to get the value of the input passed in through the props. If the value is still loading or is null, the component returns a simple div with a dash (-) in it. Otherwise, the component uses the `printType` function from the `defaultLanguageBinding` object to print out the type of the input value.\n\nThe `Spec` object defines the panel specification for this component.

So if `input` evaluates to `'x'`, when clicked, the root expression will change to `model('x')`.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component is used in the larger project to create clickable links that update the root expression. The component is styled using `styled-components` and takes a `PanelProps` object as input. The `PanelProps` object contains an `input` field, which is of type `any`, and a `config` field, which is of type `WeaveLinkConfig`. The `WeaveLinkConfig` type contains a `to` field, which is a `NodeOrVoidNode`, and a `vars` field, which is a `Frame`.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component uses the `useWeaveContext` and `usePanelContext` hooks to get the Weave context and panel context, respectively. The component then evaluates the `to` expression node and passes in any variables present in the expression as constants. The component also finds all variables in the `to` expression and uses them as template variables. The evaluated variable results are then passed back into the `to` expression as const nodes.\n\nThe `PanelWeaveLink` component is exported along with a `Spec` object that contains the component's specifications. The `Spec` object is used to create a hidden panel that can be used to create clickable links that update the root expression.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `to` field in the `WeaveLinkConfig` interface?\n   \n   The `to` field is a Weave expression Node that represents the destination of the link. Any variables present in the expression will be evaluated and passed into the expression as consts.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `vars` field in the `WeaveLinkConfig` interface?\n   \n   The `vars` field is a Frame that contains variables that are used as template variables in the `to` expression. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `updateChildPanelConfig` function in the `PanelWeaveLink` component?\n   \n   The `updateChildPanelConfig` function is currently not supported and will log a warning if called.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelWeaveLink.md"}}],["825",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/PanelWebViz.tsx)\n\nThe `PanelWebViz` component in this file is a React functional component that renders an iframe containing a WebViz preview of a ROS bag file. The component takes in a `PanelProps` object that specifies the input type as a file with the extension `.bag`. \n\nThe component first extracts the file node from the `PanelProps` object and uses the `opFileDirectUrl` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module to get the direct URL of the file. It then uses the `useNodeValue` hook from the `../../react` module to asynchronously fetch the direct URL. While the URL is being fetched, the component displays a loading spinner using the `Loader` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/WandbLoader` module.\n\nOnce the direct URL is fetched, the component constructs a URL for the WebViz preview by appending the direct URL as a query parameter to the URL of the WebViz index page. The component also appends a `telemetry` query parameter if the `thirdPartyAnalyticsOK` flag is set in the `window` object. Finally, the component renders an iframe with the constructed URL as the `src` attribute.\n\nThe `Spec` object exports a `PanelSpec` object that specifies the ID of the panel as `'web-viz'`, the `Component` as `PanelWebViz`, and the input type as a file with the extension `.bag`. This `PanelSpec` object can be used by other parts of the larger project to register the `PanelWebViz` component as a panel that can be added to the UI. \n\nExample usage:\n```jsx\nimport { Spec as WebVizSpec } from 'weave/panels/webviz';\n\n// Register the WebViz panel\nconst panels = [WebVizSpec];\n\n// Render the WebViz panel\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {panels.map(({ id, Component, inputType }) => (\n        <Component key={id} input={/* file node */} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The tooltip component is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing it to be used in various contexts throughout the application.\n\nThe main component exported from this file is `TooltipTrigger`, which is a React functional component that takes several props to customize its behavior. These props include `content`, `copyableContent`, `extraButton`, `triggerContentHeight`, `showWithoutOverflow`, `showInFullscreen`, `noHeader`, `padding`, `positionNearMouse`, `TriggerWrapperComp`, `FrameComp`, and `BodyComp`. These props allow the user to customize the appearance and behavior of the tooltip.\n\nThe `TooltipTrigger` component uses several hooks and helper functions to manage its state and behavior. The `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks are used to calculate the position of the tooltip based on the anchor element and the tooltip's dimensions. The `useCallback` hook is used to define event handlers for mouse events, such as entering, leaving, and moving within the tooltip area.\n\nThe `TooltipContent` component is responsible for rendering the actual tooltip content, including the header, body, and optional extra button. It uses the `FrameComp` and `BodyComp` props to allow for customization of the tooltip's appearance.\n\nThe `TooltipPosition` type and related functions are used to calculate the optimal position for the tooltip based on the anchor element and the tooltip's dimensions. The `POSITION_STRATEGIES` array defines several strategies for positioning the tooltip, and the `getTooltipPosition` function selects the best strategy based on the available space in the viewport.\n\nIn summary, this code provides a flexible and customizable tooltip component that can be used throughout the larger project. The tooltip can be configured to display different content, respond to various mouse events, and position itself optimally based on the available space in the viewport.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `TooltipTrigger` component and how is it used?**\n\n   The `TooltipTrigger` component is a wrapper around a trigger element that displays a tooltip with the specified content when the trigger element is hovered over. It can be used by wrapping any element with the `TooltipTrigger` component and passing the required props such as `content`, `copyableContent`, and other optional props for customization.\n\n2. **How does the `positionNearMouse` prop affect the tooltip positioning?**\n\n   The `positionNearMouse` prop, when set to `true`, positions the tooltip near the mouse cursor instead of the default positioning strategy. It listens to the `mousemove` event and updates the tooltip's position accordingly.\n\n3. **How does the `extraButton` prop work in the `TooltipTrigger` component?**\n\n   The `extraButton` prop is an optional prop that can be passed to the `TooltipTrigger` component to add an extra button in the tooltip header.

The component takes in several props such as `videoSrc`, `width`, `height`, `autoPlay`, and `muted`. \n\nThe component first creates a reference to the video element using the `useRef` hook. It then uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the video's width, height, and whether the play button is visible. It also manages the state of whether the video has loaded or not and the height of the container element using the `useRef` hook. \n\nThe component then uses the `useEffect` hook to handle the loading of the video. It creates a refresh handler to refresh the DOM node and unmutes the video if the `muted` prop is not set to `true`. It also sets the video to play automatically if the `autoPlay` prop is set to `true`. \n\nThe component then uses the `useLayoutEffect` hook to check the height of the container element and the loading spinner. If there are no failures, the DOM will load first. \n\nThe component then uses the `onLoaded` function to set the width and height of the video and sets the `videoLoaded` state to `true`. It also sets the `mediaStyles` object to contain the video and the `cardStyles` object to contain the card. \n\nThe component then returns a `Card` component from the `semantic-ui-react` library with the `headerElement`, `content`, and `footerElement`. The `content` is a placeholder if the video has not loaded yet or if there is a media failure. If the video is a `.gif`, the component renders an `img` element. Otherwise, it renders a `video` element with a play button that toggles the video's play and pause state. \n\nThe component also handles errors using the `setError` hook and the `getMediaErrorMessage` function. If there is an error, the component renders a `PanelError` component from the `@wandb/weave/common/components/elements/PanelError` library. \n\nOverall, the `VideoViewer` component is a reusable video player component with additional features such as error handling and loading placeholders. It can be used in the larger `weave` project to display videos and handle errors. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<VideoViewer\n  videoSrc=\"https://example.com/video.mp4\"\n  width={640}\n  height={360}\n  autoPlay={true}\n  muted={true}\n/>\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What are the required props for the VideoViewer component?\n- The required props for the VideoViewer component are `videoSrc`, `width`, and `height`.\n\n2.

These functions take a set of parameters that describe the properties of the new control, such as its name, class set ID, and class overlay states. The `createBaseControls` function is a helper function that creates a base set of control properties that are common to both mask and box overlays.\n\nThe `OverlayControls` interface describes a dictionary of overlay states, where each key is a unique ID for the overlay. The `OverlayState` type is a union of the `BoxControlState` and `MaskControlState` interfaces, which describe the state of a box or mask overlay respectively. The `BoxSliderState` interface describes a dictionary of bounding box slider controls, where each key is a unique name for the slider.\n\nThe `ClassState` interface describes the state of a single class, which includes a color and name.

The `ensureDashboard`, `ensureDashboardFromItems`, and `ensureSimpleDashboard` functions are used to create and ensure the correct structure for the dashboard, with the latter two functions creating a dashboard from seed items and a simple dashboard, respectively.\n\nOverall, this code is essential for managing the UI state and panel tree structure in the Weave project, allowing for easy manipulation and organization of panels within the dashboard.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What are the three types of non-leaf panels in the UI state tree?\n   **Answer**: The three types of non-leaf panels are Group, Standard panels, and TableState panels. Group panels store children in a map at config.items, Standard panels have one or more explicit children defined at a config key, and TableState panels use the older tableState format where child panel information is split across a few keys in tableState.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `ensureDashboard` function work?\n   **Answer**: The `ensureDashboard` function takes a PanelTreeNode as input and checks if it is already a Dashboard. If it is, the function returns the node as is. If not, it creates a new dashboard with the input node as the main panel and a default sidebar containing an Expression panel.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `mapPanels` function?\n   **Answer**: The `mapPanels` function is used to recursively apply a given function `fn` to all child panels in the tree, while also maintaining the stack context. This is useful for performing operations on all panels in the tree, such as updating their configurations or applying transformations.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/panelTree.md"}}],["835",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/panellib/libanalytics.ts)\n\nThe code above is responsible for recording and tracking events in the Weave project. The Weave project is not described in this code, but it can be inferred that it is a web application that requires event tracking for analytics purposes.\n\nThe code starts by declaring a global interface for the window object. This interface defines a property called \"analytics\" that is an optional object with a \"track\" method. This interface is used to ensure that the window object has the necessary properties to track events.\n\nThe \"recordWeavePanelEvent\" function is responsible for recording events in the Weave project. It takes two parameters: \"action\" and \"payload\". The \"action\" parameter is a string that describes the action being performed, and the \"payload\" parameter is an optional object that contains additional data about the event. The function creates a new object called \"data\" that contains the \"action\" property and any additional properties from the \"payload\" object. If the \"payload\" object is not provided, the \"data\" object only contains the \"action\" property. The function then calls the \"track\" method on the \"analytics\" object (if it exists) and passes in the \"data\" object and a string that describes the event (\"Weave Panel Event\").\n\nThe \"makeEventRecorder\" function is a factory function that returns a new function that can be used to record events for a specific panel in the Weave project. It takes one parameter: \"panelID\", which is a string that identifies the panel. The returned function takes the same parameters as the \"recordWeavePanelEvent\" function and calls it with the \"panelID\" parameter concatenated with the \"action\" parameter and the \"payload\" parameter.\n\nThe \"trackWeavePanelEvent\" function is responsible for tracking events in the Weave project. It takes two parameters: \"panelID\" and \"payload\". The \"panelID\" parameter is a string that identifies the panel, and the \"payload\" parameter is an optional object that contains additional data about the event. The function replaces any periods or hyphens in the \"panelID\" parameter with underscores and creates a new string called \"tableName\". The function then calls the \"track\" method on the \"analytics\" object (if it exists) and passes in the \"tableName\" string and the \"payload\" object.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to record and track events in the Weave project. The \"recordWeavePanelEvent\" function is used to record events, the \"makeEventRecorder\" function is used to create a function that can record events for a specific panel, and the \"trackWeavePanelEvent\" function is used to track events. These functions can be used throughout the Weave project to gather analytics data and improve the user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst recordEvent = makeEventRecorder('panel1');\nrecordEvent('click', {button: 'submit'});\ntrackWeavePanelEvent('panel1', {type: 'load'});\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `declare global` block at the beginning of the code?\n   - The `declare global` block is used to extend the global `Window` interface to include an optional `analytics` property that has a `track` method.\n\n2. What is the difference between the `makeEventRecorder` and `trackWeavePanelEvent` functions?\n   - The `makeEventRecorder` function returns a function that records a Weave Panel Event with a specific `panelID` and `action`, while the `trackWeavePanelEvent` function records a Weave Panel Event with a specific `panelID` and optional `payload`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the regular expressions used in the `trackWeavePanelEvent` function?\n   - The regular expressions are used to replace periods and hyphens in the `panelID` string with underscores, which is necessary for creating a valid table name for tracking the event in analytics.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/panellib/libanalytics.md"}}],["836",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/panellib/libcolors.ts)\n\nThe `useColorNode` function in this file is used to generate a color-coded version of a given `Node` object. This function is part of a larger project called `weave`, and it imports several functions and classes from the `@wandb/weave/core` library as well as the `usePanelContext` hook from a `PanelContext` file in the same directory.\n\nThe `useColorNode` function takes a single argument, `inputNode`, which is a `Node` object. It then uses the `usePanelContext` hook to access the `frame` object, which contains information about the current panel being displayed. The function then returns a memoized version of the `inputNode` object with color-coded tags based on the `frame.runColors` object.\n\nIf `frame.runColors` is null or a void node, the function returns a void node. Otherwise, it uses the `opMapEach` function to iterate over each row in the `inputNode` object and apply a `mapFn` function to it. The `mapFn` function takes a single argument, `row`, which is a `Node` object with a named tag of \"run\". It then uses the `opPick` function to select the color associated with the `opRunId` of the `row` object from the `frame.runColors` object.\n\nOverall, this function is used to generate a color-coded version of a `Node` object based on the `frame.runColors` object. This can be useful for visualizing data in a more intuitive way, especially when dealing with large datasets. Here is an example of how this function might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport {useColorNode} from 'weave';\n\nconst data = {\n  x: [1, 2, 3],\n  y: [4, 5, 6],\n  run: 'run-1',\n};\n\nconst node = {\n  data: [data],\n  tags: {\n    run: 'run-1',\n  },\n};\n\nconst colorNode = useColorNode(node);\n\nconsole.log(colorNode);\n// Output: {\n//   data: [{x: [1, 2, 3], y: [4, 5, 6], run: 'run-1'}],\n//   tags: {\n//     run: 'run-1',\n//     color: '#FF0000',\n//   },\n// }\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useColorNode` function is used to generate a color-coded version of a `Node` object that contains a single row of data with a \"run\" tag of \"run-1\". The resulting `colorNode` object contains the same data as the original `node` object, but with an additional \"color\" tag that is associated with the \"run\" tag of the data row.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `useColorNode` function?\n   - The `useColorNode` function takes in a `Node` and returns a `NodeOrVoidNode` that maps over the input node and applies color information based on the `frame.runColors` object.\n2. What is the `frame` object and where does it come from?\n   - The `frame` object is obtained from the `usePanelContext` hook imported from the `PanelContext` file located in the same directory as this file.\n3. What is the `opMapEach` function and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `opMapEach` function is a higher-order function that takes in an object and a mapping function and applies the mapping function to each key-value pair in the object.

These functions are designed to be used by any panel that constructs and maintains an expression in their own config.\n\nThe `useRefineExpressionEffect` function takes in an expression, frame, and update callback, and updates the expression asynchronously if needed. The function returns a boolean that acts as a \"loading\" guard and will be `true` when the expression is in the async process of refinement. The panel should not load any children panels as the output node is unsafe at that time. The refinement will happen on the first load of the panel, allowing for type system/cg updates, as well as any time variables referenced by the expression change.\n\nThe `useRefineExpressionsEffect` function is similar to `useRefineExpressionEffect`, but it takes in an array of expressions instead of just one. This function also returns a boolean that acts as a \"loading\" guard.\n\nBoth functions use the `makePromiseUsable` function from the `../PanelTable/hooks` module to make the refinement process asynchronous and usable with React hooks.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a convenient way for panels to update their expressions asynchronously and ensure that the expressions are always up-to-date with any changes in variables or the type system. Panels can use these functions to provide a smoother user experience and avoid any potential errors that may arise from outdated expressions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useRefineExpressionEffect } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyPanel(props) {\n  const [expression, setExpression] = useState('some expression');\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setIsLoading(true);\n    useRefineExpressionEffect(expression, props.frame, (refinedExpression) => {\n      setExpression(refinedExpression);\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    });\n  }, [expression, props.frame]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isLoading ? <p>Loading...</p> : <p>{expression}</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `makePromiseUsable` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `makePromiseUsable` function is used to convert a promise-based function into a function that can be used with React's `useEffect` hook. It is used to create two new functions, `useRefineExpressionEffect` and `useRefineExpressionsEffect`, which can be used to asynchronously update expressions in a panel's config.\n\n2. What is the expected pattern for using the `useRefineExpressionEffect` and `useRefineExpressionsEffect` functions?\n- The expected pattern is that a panel will construct a frame using its input nodes and call the appropriate `use` function. The returned boolean will act as a \"loading\" guard and will be `true` while the expression is being refined. The panel should not load any children panels during this time.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `refineExpression` and `refineExpressions` functions?\n- The `refineExpression` function is used to asynchronously update a single expression in a panel's config, while the `refineExpressions` function is used to update multiple expressions at once.

The `initialize` property is a function that is called when the panel is first created, and it returns the initial configuration for the panel. The `inputType` property specifies the type of data that the panel expects as input, and the `outputType` property specifies the type of data that the panel produces as output. The `ConfigComponent` property is a React component that renders the configuration options for the panel. \n\nThe `PanelConvertSpec` interface is similar to `PanelSpec`, but it is used for panels that convert the input data to a different type. The `convert` property is a function that takes the input type and returns the output type. \n\nThe `PanelPropsInternal` interface defines the properties that are passed to a panel component. These include the input data, the context object, the configuration options, and functions for updating the context and configuration. \n\nThe `getDisplayName` function takes a `PanelSpecNode` object and returns the display name for the panel. If the `displayName` property is set, it is used as the display name. Otherwise, the ID of the panel is split into words and capitalized, and the words are joined together to form the display name. \n\nThe `getStackIdAndName` function takes a `PanelSpecNode` object and returns an object with the ID and display name of the panel. If the panel has a child panel, the child's ID and display name are appended to the parent's ID and display name, separated by a \"▸\" character.

Both interfaces also have an optional `isValid` property, which is a function that takes a configuration object and returns a boolean indicating whether the configuration is valid. \n\nThe file also defines a type `TypedInputHandlerStack<T, H, C>`, which is either a `TypedInputHandler` or a `TypedInputConverter` with an additional `child` property that is itself a `TypedInputHandlerStack`. This type is used to represent a stack of input handlers and converters for a given input type `T`. \n\nFinally, the file defines a function `_getTypeHandlerStacks` that takes a current type `T`, an array of `TypedInputHandler` objects, an array of `TypedInputConverter` objects, a function `isAssignableTo` that checks whether one type is assignable to another, an optional parent converter ID, and an optional boolean indicating whether a multi-table is an ancestor. The function returns an array of `TypedInputHandlerStack` objects representing the stack of input handlers and converters for the given type `T`. \n\nThe function first determines the number of dimensions of the current type using the `nDims` function from the `@wandb/weave/core` module. If the type has one dimension, the function creates an object type using the `listObjectType` and `nullableTaggableValue` functions from the same module. The function then filters the input handlers to exclude any that are not assignable to the current type using the `isAssignableTo` function passed as an argument. \n\nThe function then iterates over the input converters and checks whether each can convert the current type. If so, the function recursively calls itself with the converted type and concatenates the resulting `TypedInputHandlerStack` objects with the result array. If the converter has an ID of \"maybe\", the function filters the resulting `TypedInputHandlerStack` objects to exclude any that are assignable to the \"none\" type. \n\nEach resulting `TypedInputHandlerStack` object has a `child` property that is itself a `TypedInputHandlerStack` object representing the next level of the stack. The `isValid` property of each `TypedInputHandlerStack` object is a function that first checks whether the converter's `isValid` function returns `false`, and if not, checks whether the child's `isValid` function returns `false`. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to handle and convert typed inputs in the larger \"weave\" project.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of this file and what does it contain?\n- This file contains the implementation of a \"pure weave panel\", which is defined entirely in terms of weave objects, with no corresponding React components. It imports various modules and functions, defines some interfaces and types, and registers user panels.\n\n2. What are the different functions and hooks used in this code?\n- The code uses various functions and hooks such as `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useNodeValue`, `useGatedValue`, and `usePanelContext`. It also imports functions from external libraries such as `getConfig` from `../../config` and `memoize` from `lodash`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `registerUserPanel` function?\n- The `registerUserPanel` function is used to register a user panel with the system. It takes in various parameters such as the panel ID, render op, config op, and initialize op, and then registers the panel by calling the `registerPanel` function. The function also defines and returns two components, `ConfigComponent` and `RenderComponent`, which are used to render the panel.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Panel2/weaveBackend.md"}}],["844",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Config.tsx)\n\nThis code defines a set of styled components for a UI container that can be used in the larger Weave project. The `import` statement at the beginning of the code imports some global styles and CSS variables from the `@wandb/weave` package. The `styled-components` library is also imported to create the styled components.\n\nThe `Container` component is a flex container that has a vertical direction and hidden overflow. It takes up the full height of its parent element.\n\nThe `Header` component is a container for the header section of the UI. It has a top and bottom padding of 12 pixels and a bottom border of 1 pixel that is colored with a gray color defined in the `globals.styles` file.\n\nThe `HeaderTop` component is a flex container that has space between its child elements and aligns them to the center. It has a left padding of 12 pixels by default, but this can be reduced to 8 pixels by passing a `lessLeftPad` prop. \n\nThe `HeaderTopLeft` component is a flex container that aligns its child elements to the center. It has a gray color and a cursor that changes to a pointer when the `canGoBack` prop is passed.\n\nThe `HeaderTopRight` component is a flex container that aligns its child elements to the center.\n\nThe `HeaderTopText` component is a text element that has a font weight of 600.\n\nThe `HeaderTitle` component is a text element that has a custom font family and size, a font weight of 600, and a top margin of 8 pixels.\n\nThe `Body` component is a container for the body section of the UI. It has a flex-grow property of 1, which allows it to take up all available space in the container. It has hidden overflow in the x-axis and visible overflow in the y-axis, which allows for scrolling. It also applies some custom scrollbar styles defined in the `globals.styles` file.\n\nThese components can be used to create a UI container with a header and body section that has a consistent style throughout the Weave project. For example, the `HeaderTitle` component can be used to display the title of a page or section, and the `Body` component can be used to display content that can be scrolled if it overflows the container.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code is part of the `weave` project, but it is unclear what the project does or what its goals are.\n\n2. What is the expected behavior of the `HeaderTopLeft` component when `canGoBack` is true?\n- It is unclear what the `canGoBack` prop does or how it affects the `HeaderTopLeft` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SCROLLBAR_STYLES` constant and where is it defined?\n- The code imports `SCROLLBAR_STYLES` from another module, but it is unclear what it does or how it is defined.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Config.md"}}],["845",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Inspector.tsx)\n\nThe code defines a React component called `Inspector` that takes in two props: `active` and `children`. The `active` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not the component is active, and the `children` prop is any content that should be displayed within the component. The component is exported as both a named export and a default export.\n\nThe `Container` and `Content` styled components are also defined in this file. The `Container` component is a styled `div` that takes in an `active` prop and sets various CSS properties based on its value. If `active` is `true`, the component will have a left border of 1 pixel solid `#e5e5e5` and a width of `WIDTH_PX` pixels. If `active` is `false`, the component will have no left border and a width of 0 pixels. The `Content` component is a styled `div` that has a fixed width of `WIDTH_PX` pixels and a height of 100%.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to create a sidebar or inspector component that can be toggled on and off. The `active` prop can be controlled by a parent component to show or hide the `Inspector` component. The `children` prop can be used to pass in any content that should be displayed within the `Inspector`. For example, if the `Inspector` component is used to display information about a selected item, the `children` prop could be used to pass in details about that item.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Inspector` component could be used in a parent component:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Inspector from './Inspector';\n\nconst ParentComponent = () => {\n  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    setIsActive(!isActive);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Toggle Inspector</button>\n      <Inspector active={isActive}>\n        <p>Details about the selected item:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Name: Item 1</li>\n          <li>Price: $10</li>\n          <li>Description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </Inspector>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Inspector` component?\n- The `Inspector` component is a functional component that takes in an `active` boolean prop and `children` prop, and returns a `Container` component with the `active` prop and `Content` component as its children.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Container` styled component?\n- The `Container` styled component is a div that has a `flex-shrink` property of 0, a font size of 15px, and an overflow of hidden. It also has a border-left of 1px solid #e5e5e5 if the `active` prop is true, and a width of 0px if the `active` prop is false. If the `active` prop is true, the width is set to 328px. \n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Content` styled component?\n- The `Content` styled component is a div that has a fixed width of 328px and a height of 100%. It is a child component of the `Container` component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Inspector.md"}}],["846",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Outline.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project is a React-based data visualization tool. The code in this file defines the `Outline` component, which is used to display a hierarchical outline of the panels in the visualization. The `Outline` component is composed of `OutlinePanel` components, which recursively render the children of each panel.\n\nThe `Outline` component takes in several props, including the `config` object, which contains the configuration for the entire visualization, and functions to update the configuration and select panels. The `Outline` component renders a single `OutlinePanel` component with the name \"root\" and the `config` object as its `localConfig` prop.\n\nThe `OutlinePanel` component takes in several props, including the `name` of the panel, its `localConfig` object, and its `path` in the hierarchy. The `OutlinePanel` component renders the name of the panel, an icon, and a button to open a menu of options for the panel. If the panel has children, the `OutlinePanel` component also renders a toggle button to expand or collapse the children, and recursively renders `OutlinePanel` components for each child.\n\nThe `styled-components` library is used extensively in this file to define the styles for the various components. The `IconButton` and `OutlineItemPopupMenu` components are imported from other files in the project.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Outline` component might be used in the larger `weave` project:\n\n```jsx\nimport {Outline} from 'weave/components/Outline';\nimport {useConfig, useSelected} from 'weave/hooks';\n\nconst MyVisualization = () => {\n  const [config, setConfig] = useConfig();\n  const [selected, setSelected] = useSelected();\n\n  const handleConfigUpdate = newConfig => {\n    setConfig(newConfig);\n  };\n\n  const handlePanelSelect = path => {\n    setSelected(path);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Outline\n        config={config}\n        updateConfig={handleConfigUpdate}\n        selected={selected}\n        setSelected={handlePanelSelect}\n      />\n      {/* rest of visualization */}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyVisualization` component uses the `useConfig` and `useSelected` hooks from the `weave` project to get and set the configuration and selected panels. The `Outline` component is rendered at the top of the visualization, and its props are passed the necessary functions and state from the `MyVisualization` component.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project?\n- Unfortunately, the code provided does not give any indication of the purpose of the `weave` project. \n\n2. What is the role of the `Outline` component?\n- The `Outline` component is a React functional component that renders an outline of a panel configuration. It takes in several props including `config`, `updateConfig`, `selected`, and `setSelected`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `usePanelIsHoveredByPath` and `useSetPanelIsHoveredInOutline` hooks?\n- The `usePanelIsHoveredByPath` hook returns a boolean value indicating whether a panel is currently being hovered over in the outline. The `useSetPanelIsHoveredInOutline` hook returns a function that can be used to set the hover state of a panel in the outline. These hooks are used in the `OutlinePanelTitle` component to handle hover events.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Outline.md"}}],["847",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/OutlineItemPopupMenu.tsx)\n\nThe `OutlineItemPopupMenu` module is a React component that renders a popup menu with a set of actions that can be performed on an outline item. The component takes in a set of props that include the configuration of the outline item, its local configuration, its path in the panel tree, and a set of functions to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The component also takes in a trigger element that is used to display the popup menu.\n\nThe popup menu contains a set of actions that can be performed on the outline item. These actions include deleting the item, replacing the item with its first child, duplicating the item, splitting the item into two panels, and sending the item to the query bar. The actions are implemented using a set of callback functions that update the configuration of the item and the panel tree.\n\nThe `handleDelete` function deletes the outline item from the panel tree. It uses the `updateConfig` function to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The function first creates a draft of the configuration using the `produce` function from the `immer` library. It then traverses the panel tree to find the outline item and deletes it from the tree.\n\nThe `handleUnnest` function replaces the outline item with its first child. It uses the `updateConfig2` function to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The function first gets the full child panel of the item using the `getFullChildPanel` function. It then gets the target panel from the panel tree and replaces the outline item with its first child.\n\nThe `handleSplit` function splits the outline item into two panels. It uses the `updateConfig2` function to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The function first gets the full child panel of the item using the `getFullChildPanel` function. It then gets the target panel from the panel tree and creates a new group panel with two child panels that are copies of the target panel.\n\nThe `handleDuplicate` function duplicates the outline item. It uses the `updateConfig2` function to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The function first gets the full child panel of the item using the `getFullChildPanel` function. It then gets the target panel from the panel tree and adds a copy of the panel to its parent.\n\nThe `handleAddToQueryBar` function sends the outline item to the query bar. It uses the `updateConfig2` function to update the configuration of the item and the panel tree. The function first gets the full child panel of the item using the `getFullChildPanel` function. It then gets the target panel from the panel tree and creates a new query panel with the target panel as its input. The function then adds the query panel to the sidebar of the panel tree.\n\nThe `menuItems` variable is an array of objects that represent the actions that can be performed on the outline item. Each object contains a key, a content string, an icon element, and an onClick function that is called when the action is performed. The `menuItems` array is created using the `useMemo` hook and is dependent on the local configuration of the outline item, its path in the panel tree, and the callback functions that update the configuration of the item and the panel tree.\n\nThe `OutlineItemPopupMenu` component is exported as a memoized version of the `OutlineItemPopupMenuComp` component. This ensures that the component is only re-rendered when its props change.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `OutlineItemPopupMenu` that renders a popup menu with various options for manipulating a panel in a dashboard outline.\n\n2. What other files or modules does this code depend on?\n- This code imports several functions and components from other files in the `weave` project, including `callOpVeryUnsafe`, `NodeOrVoidNode`, `varNode`, `produce`, `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `getFullChildPanel`, `emptyTable`, `addChild`, `ensureDashboard`, `getPath`, `isGroupNode`, `makePanel`, `setPath`, `OutlinePanelProps`, `IconBack`, `IconCopy`, `IconDelete`, `IconRetry`, `IconSplit`, and `PopupMenu`.\n\n3. What are the different actions that can be performed using the popup menu?\n- The popup menu allows the user to delete the panel, replace it with its first child (if it is a group panel), duplicate it, split it into two identical panels, or send it to the query bar (if it is the main panel and not the root panel).","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/OutlineItemPopupMenu.md"}}],["848",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/PopupMenu.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports a `PopupMenu` component. This component is a styled popup menu that can be used in other parts of the project. The component is built using `React`, `semantic-ui-react`, `lodash`, and `styled-components`.\n\nThe `PopupMenu` component takes in several props, including `trigger`, `position`, `items`, and `sections`. The `trigger` prop specifies the element that will trigger the popup menu, while the `position` prop specifies the position of the popup menu relative to the trigger element. The `items` prop is an array of `StrictMenuItemProps` objects that represent the items in the menu. The `sections` prop is an optional array of `Section` objects that represent sections of the menu. Each `Section` object has a `label` property and an `items` property that is an array of `StrictMenuItemProps` objects.\n\nThe `PopupMenu` component uses `useMemo` to create a new array of menu items that includes both the `items` and the `sections`. The `sectionToItems` function is used to convert each `Section` object into an array of `MenuItemProps` objects that include a header and the items in the section. The resulting array of menu items is then passed to the `content` prop of the `Popup` component.\n\nThe `Popup` component is a styled `SemanticPopup` component that is used to create the popup menu. The `Menu` component is a styled `SemanticMenu` component that is used to style the menu items. The `Popup` and `Menu` components are both styled using `styled-components`.\n\nOverall, the `PopupMenu` component provides a reusable popup menu that can be used in other parts of the `weave` project. The component is flexible and can be customized using the various props that it accepts.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code is a component called `PopupMenu` that renders a popup menu with sections and items. It is not clear from this file alone what the overall purpose of the `weave` project is.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code and how are they being used?\n- This code imports several modules from `lodash`, `react`, `semantic-ui-react`, and `styled-components`. These dependencies are used to define types, components, and styles for the `PopupMenu` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `allItems` variable and how is it being computed?\n- The `allItems` variable is an array of `MenuItemProps` that combines the `items` and `sections` props passed to the `PopupMenu` component. It is computed using the `useMemo` hook and a helper function called `sectionToItems` that maps each section to an array of menu items.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/PopupMenu.md"}}],["849",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.tsx)\n\nThe `weave` project includes a file called `Sidebar` that exports a React component called `Sidebar`.

The sidebar can be collapsed or expanded, and includes a close button that triggers a callback function passed in as a prop.\n\nThe `getConfigWithDefaults` function is also included in this file. This function takes two arguments: `configSpec` and `config`. `configSpec` is an object that defines the expected shape of the `config` object, and includes default values for any properties that are not present in `config`. `config` is an object that contains configuration options for the `weave` project. The function returns a new object that combines the properties of `config` and `configSpec`, using the default values from `configSpec` if a property is not present in `config`.\n\nThe `Sidebar` component takes three props: `className`, `collapsed`, and `close`. `className` is an optional string that can be used to apply custom CSS classes to the component. `collapsed` is a boolean that determines whether the sidebar is collapsed or expanded. `close` is a callback function that is triggered when the close button is clicked.\n\nThe component renders a `Wrapper` component from the `Sidebar.styles` module, which includes a `Title` component and a `Main` component. The `Title` component includes a `BarButton` component that triggers the `close` callback when clicked. The `Main` component includes the `children` prop, which is used to render the main content of the sidebar.\n\nThis component can be used in the `weave` project to render a sidebar with custom content and configuration options. The `getConfigWithDefaults` function can be used to ensure that the configuration options passed to the `Sidebar` component have the correct shape and default values. Here is an example of how the `Sidebar` component might be used in the `weave` project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Sidebar, {getConfigWithDefaults} from 'weave/Sidebar';\n\nconst configSpec = {\n  title: {\n    type: 'string',\n    default: 'My Sidebar',\n  },\n  color: {\n    type: 'string',\n    default: 'blue',\n  },\n};\n\nconst config = {\n  title: 'Custom Title',\n};\n\nconst SidebarWithDefaults = (props) => {\n  const configWithDefaults = getConfigWithDefaults(configSpec, config);\n  return <Sidebar {...props} {...configWithDefaults} />;\n};\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SidebarWithDefaults collapsed={false} close={() => console.log('Closed')}>\n        <p>This is the main content of the sidebar.</p>\n      </SidebarWithDefaults>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What are the props that can be passed to the `Sidebar` component?\n   - The `Sidebar` component accepts a `className` prop (optional string), a `collapsed` prop (boolean), and a `close` prop (function).\n3. What is the purpose of the `S` import and how is it used in this file?\n   - The `S` import is an alias for a module that exports styled components used in the `Sidebar` component.

The sidebar is implemented as a `div` element with a fixed position and a width that can be toggled between 0 and 300 pixels. The sidebar contains a title, a main content area, and several other components that are used to display and edit properties of the application.\n\nThe `styled-components` library is used to define the styles for each component. The `Wrapper` component sets the height and width of the sidebar, as well as its background color, position, and border. The `Title` component defines the styles for the title of the sidebar, including its padding and alignment. The `Main` component sets the styles for the main content area of the sidebar, including its flex-grow property and overflow behavior. The `PropertyEditorWrapper` and `InspectorPropertyWrapper` components define the styles for two different types of property editors that are displayed in the sidebar. Finally, the `BarButton` component defines the styles for a button that is used to collapse and expand the sidebar.\n\nThese components can be used in a larger web application to create a sidebar that can be collapsed and expanded by the user. For example, the `Wrapper` component could be used to create a sidebar that displays a list of items, while the `PropertyEditorWrapper` and `InspectorPropertyWrapper` components could be used to create forms for editing the properties of those items. The `BarButton` component could be used to create a button that toggles the visibility of the sidebar.\n\nHere is an example of how these components could be used in a React application:\n\n```jsx\nimport React, {useState} from 'react';\nimport {\n  Wrapper,\n  Title,\n  Main,\n  PropertyEditorWrapper,\n  InspectorPropertyWrapper,\n  InspectorPropertyLabel,\n  BarButton,\n} from 'weave';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [collapsed, setCollapsed] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <Wrapper collapsed={collapsed}>\n      <Title>\n        <BarButton icon=\"bars\" onClick={() => setCollapsed(!collapsed)} />\n      </Title>\n      <Main>\n        <PropertyEditorWrapper>\n          <InspectorPropertyWrapper>\n            <InspectorPropertyLabel>Property 1:</InspectorPropertyLabel>\n            <input type=\"text\" />\n          </InspectorPropertyWrapper>\n          <InspectorPropertyWrapper>\n            <InspectorPropertyLabel>Property 2:</InspectorPropertyLabel>\n            <input type=\"text\" />\n          </InspectorPropertyWrapper>\n        </PropertyEditorWrapper>\n      </Main>\n    </Wrapper>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `Wrapper` component is used to create a sidebar that contains two property editors. The `collapsed` prop is used to toggle the width of the sidebar between 0 and 300 pixels. The `Title` component contains a `BarButton` that toggles the value of `collapsed` when clicked. The `Main` component contains the `PropertyEditorWrapper`, which in turn contains two `InspectorPropertyWrapper` components. Each `InspectorPropertyWrapper` contains a label and an input field for editing a property.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is used to define the styles for the various components in the code.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Barbutton` component and how is it different from the `Button` component from `semantic-ui-react`?\n- The `Barbutton` component is a custom styled component that extends the `Button` component from `semantic-ui-react`. It adds additional styles and functionality to the `Button` component.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.styles.md"}}],["851",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarPopout.tsx)\n\nThe `SidebarPopout` component in the `weave` project is a React functional component that renders a popout sidebar. The purpose of this component is to display a sidebar that pops out from a specified anchor element. The component takes in three props: `className`, `anchor`, and `onPopoutChange`. \n\nThe `className` prop is an optional string that can be used to add additional CSS classes to the component. The `anchor` prop is a required `HTMLElement` that specifies the element from which the popout sidebar should be anchored. The `onPopoutChange` prop is an optional function that is called when the popout sidebar is rendered or removed. This function takes in an `HTMLElement` or `null` as an argument.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage the state of the popout sidebar's position. The `useState` hook initializes the `position` state to `null`. The `useEffect` hook is called whenever the `anchor` prop changes and calculates the position of the popout sidebar based on the position of the anchor element. The position is calculated relative to the top-right origin because the inspector is on the right.\n\nIf the `position` state is `null`, the component returns an empty fragment. Otherwise, the component uses the `createPortal` method from `ReactDOM` to render the popout sidebar as a child of the `document.body` element. The `createPortal` method allows the popout sidebar to be rendered outside of the component's parent element, which is necessary for the popout effect.\n\nThe `Wrapper` component from the `SidebarPopout.styles` module is used to render the popout sidebar. The `Wrapper` component takes in the `className`, `position`, and `ref` props. The `className` prop is passed through from the `SidebarPopout` component. The `position` prop is an object that contains the `x` and `y` coordinates of the popout sidebar. The `ref` prop is used to call the `onPopoutChange` function with the `node` argument, which is the `HTMLElement` of the popout sidebar.\n\nOverall, the `SidebarPopout` component is a reusable component that can be used to render a popout sidebar anchored to a specified element. It provides flexibility through the `className` prop and the `onPopoutChange` callback function. Here is an example usage of the `SidebarPopout` component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport SidebarPopout from './SidebarPopout';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = React.useState(null);\n\n  const handleAnchorClick = (event) => {\n    setAnchorEl(event.currentTarget);\n  };\n\n  const handlePopoutChange = (node) => {\n    console.log(node);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleAnchorClick}>Open Sidebar</button>\n      <SidebarPopout anchor={anchorEl} onPopoutChange={handlePopoutChange}>\n        <p>This is the content of the sidebar.</p>\n      </SidebarPopout>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `SidebarPopout` component?\n- The `SidebarPopout` component is a React functional component that renders a popout sidebar based on the provided `anchor` element.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `position` state variable?\n- The `position` state variable is used to store the coordinates of the popout sidebar relative to the top-right origin of the screen, because the inspector is on the right.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `createPortal` method from `ReactDOM`?\n- The `createPortal` method is used to render the popout sidebar as a child of the `document.body` element, rather than as a child of the `SidebarPopout` component's parent element. This allows the popout sidebar to be positioned outside of the component's parent element.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarPopout.md"}}],["852",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/Sidebar/SidebarPopout.styles.ts)\n\nThe code above is a styled component that creates a fixed position div element with a white background, padding of 8 pixels, and a border of 1 pixel solid color. The position of the div is determined by the x and y coordinates passed in as props. The div is positioned to the right and top of the screen based on these coordinates.

Otherwise, the `Vars` component is rendered, which maps over the list of `ChildPanelConfig` objects and renders a `Var` component for each one. \n\nThe `Var` component displays the name of the variable as a label and renders an expression editor for editing the variable's value. The expression editor is implemented using the `ExpressionConfigField` component from the `ConfigPanel` module. The `Var` component also renders a menu button with a \"Delete\" option for deleting the variable. \n\nThe `Vars` component also calculates a list of sibling variables for each variable, which are passed down to the `PanelContextProvider` component.

The purpose of this component is to provide a customizable tooltip that can be used throughout the larger project.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component is defined as a styled version of the `Popup` component, with some additional attributes and styles. The `basic` attribute is set to `true`, which removes the pointing arrow from the tooltip. The `mouseEnterDelay` attribute is set to `500`, which adds a delay before the tooltip appears when the user hovers over the element. The `popperModifiers` attribute is an object that contains a `preventOverflow` property, which prevents the tooltip from being positioned outside of the viewport.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component also has some custom styles defined using the `&&` syntax, which allows for more specific targeting of the component's styles. The `color` property sets the text color to white, the `background` property sets the background color to a dark gray, the `border-color` property sets the border color to a slightly lighter gray, and the `box-shadow` property adds a subtle shadow effect to the tooltip. The `font-size` and `line-height` properties set the text size and spacing, and the `max-width` property limits the width of the tooltip to 300 pixels.\n\nThis `Tooltip` component can be used throughout the larger project by importing it and using it as a component in other parts of the code.

The component receives four props: `dataTest`, `onCommit`, `validateInput`, and `initialValue`. \n\nThe `dataTest` prop is a string used to identify the component in tests. The `onCommit` prop is a callback function that is called when the user commits a new value by pressing the Enter key or blurring the input field. The `validateInput` prop is a function that receives the current value of the input field and returns a boolean indicating whether the value is valid or not. Finally, the `initialValue` prop is an optional string that sets the initial value of the input field.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage three states: `initialValue`, `internalValue`, and `isValid`. The `initialValue` state is set to the value of the `initialValue` prop or an empty string if the prop is not provided. The `internalValue` state is used to store the current value of the input field and is initialized with the value of `initialValue`. The `isValid` state is a boolean that indicates whether the current value of the input field is valid according to the `validateInput` function.\n\nThe component also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the input field and the `useCallback` hook to create a memoized version of the `handleBlur` function.\n\nThe `handleChange` function is called every time the user types a character in the input field and updates the `internalValue` state accordingly. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isValid` state every time the `internalValue` state changes by calling the `validateInput` function.\n\nThe `handleBlur` function is called when the input field loses focus and checks whether the `internalValue` state has changed. If it has, it checks whether the new value is valid. If it is, it updates the `initialValue` state and calls the `onCommit` function with the new value. If it is not, it resets the `internalValue` state to the `initialValue` state.\n\nThe `handleKeyDown` function is called every time the user presses a key in the input field and checks whether the key is the Enter key. If it is, it prevents the default behavior of submitting the form and calls the `blur` method of the input field to trigger the `handleBlur` function.\n\nOverall, this component can be used in a larger project to render input fields that require validation and commit their values when the user presses the Enter key or blurs the field. It provides a simple and reusable way to handle user input and validation in a React application. Here's an example of how it can be used:\n\n```\nimport { ValidatingTextInput } from 'weave';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const validateInput = (value) => value.length > 0;\n  const onCommit = (newValue) => console.log(`New value: ${newValue}`);\n\n  return (\n    <ValidatingTextInput\n      dataTest=\"my-input\"\n      validateInput={validateInput}\n      onCommit={onCommit}\n      initialValue=\"Hello, world!\"\n    />\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `config` prop is an object that contains information about the section, including its `id`, `name`, `panels`, `isOpen`, `flowConfig`, `type`, and `sorted`. The `groupPath` prop is an array of strings that represents the path to the current section in the panel bank. The `enableAddPanel` prop determines whether a button to add a new panel is displayed. The `updateConfig2` prop is a function that updates the section's configuration. The `renderPanel` prop is a function that renders a panel. The `handleAddPanel` prop is a function that adds a new panel to the section.\n\nThe component renders a `Sections` div that contains a `PanelBankSectionComponent` component, which is either a `PanelBankGridSection` or `PanelBankFlowSection` depending on the `mode` prop. The `PanelBankSectionComponent` component renders the panels in the section using the `renderPanel` prop. The component also renders an `ActionBar` div that contains a button to open the panel editor and a button to add a new panel. If the `enableAddPanel` prop is false, the add panel button is not displayed. \n\nThe `PBSection` component uses several hooks, including `useSelectedPath`, `useSetInspectingPanel`, `useGetPanelIsHoveredByGroupPath`, `useGetPanelIsHoveredInOutlineByGroupPath`, and `useSetPanelIsHovered`. These hooks provide functionality for selecting, inspecting, and hovering over panels in the panel bank.\n\nOverall, the `PBSection` component is a reusable component that renders a section of panels in a panel bank.

It is used to create a callback that updates the configuration by applying the given `action` function on the current configuration. This allows for a more efficient and reusable way to handle updates to the configuration.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `convertToGridCoords` function work and what is its purpose?\n   **Answer**: The `convertToGridCoords` function takes pixel values (xPx and yPx) as input and converts them to grid coordinates (x and y). It calculates the grid coordinates by dividing the pixel values by the sum of the column width and grid item margin, and then rounding the result. This function is useful for converting pixel-based positions to grid-based positions, which can be used for layout calculations and positioning elements within the grid.\n\n3. **Question**: How does the `PanelBankGridSection` component handle resizing and dragging of panels within the grid?\n   **Answer**: The `PanelBankGridSection` component uses the `Resizable` and `DragSource` components to handle resizing and dragging of panels within the grid. The `Resizable` component wraps each panel and provides resizing functionality, while the `DragSource` component is used for handling drag events and data. The component also maintains state variables for resizing and dragging, such as `resizingRefId`, `resizingPixelWidth`, `resizingPixelHeight`, and `dragging`.

The SectionPanelSorting enum defines different ways to sort the panels within a section. The PanelBankSectionConfig interface defines an object with various properties that are used to configure a section, including its id, name, panels, isOpen status, flowConfig, type, and sorted. \n\nThe PanelBankSectionComponentSharedProps interface defines a set of shared props that are used by both PanelBankFlowSection and PanelBankGridSection components. The isPanel function is a type guard that checks if a given DragRef is a LayedOutPanel. The isDraggingWithinSection function checks if a given DragData object is dragging within a given panel bank section. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of shared components and utilities that can be used to create a panel bank with drag and drop functionality. Developers can use these interfaces, types, and functions to create custom panel bank components that fit their specific needs. For example, they can use the PanelBankSectionConfig interface to define the configuration for a panel bank section, and they can use the isPanel function to check if a given DragRef is a panel.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The grid system has a fixed number of columns (24) and a fixed row height (32px). Each panel in the grid is represented by a `GridLayoutItem` object, which contains layout parameters such as position (x, y), width, height, and an ID.\n\nThe main functions provided by this code are:\n\n- `getLayoutItem(layout, id)`: Retrieves a layout item by its ID from the given layout.\n- `sortLayoutItems(layoutItems)`: Sorts layout items from top-left to bottom-right.\n- `moveGridItem(layout, l, x, y, isUserAction, cols)`: Moves a grid item to a new position (x, y) and handles cascading movements of other items to avoid collisions.\n- `moveGridItemAwayFromCollision(layout, collidesWith, itemToMove, isUserAction, cols)`: Moves an item away from a collision with another item.\n- `getFirstCollision(layout, layoutItem)`: Returns the first item that collides with the given layout item.\n- `getAllCollisions(layout, layoutItem)`: Returns all items that collide with the given layout item.\n- `collides(l1, l2)`: Checks if two layout items collide.\n- `compact(layout, cols)`: Compacts the layout by removing gaps between items.\n- `bottom(layout)`: Returns the bottom coordinate of the layout.\n- `findNextPanelLoc(layouts, gridWidth, panelWidth)`: Finds the next available position for a new panel in the grid.\n- `getNewGridItemLayout(gridLayout, fatPanel)`: Returns the layout parameters for a new grid item.\n\nThese functions can be used to manage the positioning and layout of panels in a grid system, ensuring that panels do not overlap and that the layout remains compact and organized. For example, when adding a new panel to the grid, the `getNewGridItemLayout` function can be used to determine the appropriate position and dimensions for the new panel.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `moveGridItem` function and how does it handle collisions?\n   **Answer**: The `moveGridItem` function is responsible for moving a grid item to a new position (x, y) in the layout. It handles collisions by moving the colliding items away from the element being moved, either up if there's room or down otherwise, using the `moveGridItemAwayFromCollision` function.\n\n2. **Question**: How does the `compact` function work and when should it be used?\n   **Answer**: The `compact` function takes a layout and compacts it by removing gaps between items along the y-axis. It should be used when you want to ensure that the layout items are tightly packed together without any unnecessary empty spaces between them.\n\n3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `getNewGridItemLayout` function and how does it handle fat panels?\n   **Answer**: The `getNewGridItemLayout` function is used to get the layout parameters for a new grid item, ensuring that it is placed in an appropriate position within the existing layout. It handles fat panels (wider grid items) by calling the `findNextFatPanelLoc` function, which finds the next available location for a fat panel in the layout, considering the specific constraints for fat panels.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/components/WeavePanelBank/panelbankGrid.md"}}],["865",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/components/WeavePanelBank/panelbankUtil.ts)\n\nThis code is part of the larger project called \"weave\" and is divided into two parts.

This information can be used in other parts of the project to provide browser-specific functionality or to handle browser-specific bugs.\n\nThe second part of the code exports a function called `skipTransition` that takes an HTML element and an optional `disableDuration` parameter. This function temporarily disables the CSS transition of the given element by setting its `transition` property to `'none'` and then restoring the original value after a specified duration. This can be useful when you want to skip a transition for a specific action, such as when you want to immediately hide an element without it fading out. \n\nHere's an example of how `skipTransition` can be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { skipTransition } from 'weave';\n\nconst element = document.getElementById('my-element');\n\n// Disable the transition for 1 second\nskipTransition(element, 1000);\n\n// Immediately hide the element\nelement.style.display = 'none';\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides useful utility functions that can be used throughout the \"weave\" project to handle browser-specific behavior and to manipulate CSS transitions.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The code exports two functions: `useWeaveAutomation` and `onAppError`. \n\n`useWeaveAutomation` is a React hook that takes an `automationId` as input and returns a function that can be used to automate certain tasks. The function first loads the `weave` configuration using the `getConfig` function. It then uses the `useLoadWeaveObjects` hook to load the `remoteOpStore` and check if the `loading` flag is set. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns without doing anything. Otherwise, it sets the `activeAutomationId` variable to the `automationId` passed as input. \n\nThe function then sets up a loop that runs as long as the `shouldRun` variable is true. Within the loop, it calls the `getCommands` function to fetch any new commands that have been sent to the server since the last time the function was called. If the response status is not 200, the function logs an error and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it parses the response as a `ServerCommandsResponse` object and loops through each command in the `commands` array. \n\nIf the command is a `run_js` command, the function evaluates the JavaScript code contained in the `js` property of the command using the `eval` function. If an error occurs during evaluation, the function logs the error and sends an error status to the server using the `sendStatusError` function. It then sets `shouldRun` to false and breaks out of the loop. If the command is an `end` command, the function sets `shouldRun` to false and sends an OK status to the server using the `sendStatusOk` function. If the command is neither a `run_js` nor an `end` command, the function logs an error and sends an error status to the server using the `sendStatusError` function. It then sets `shouldRun` to false and breaks out of the loop. \n\nThe function waits for one second after processing each command using the `timeout` function. Once all commands have been processed, the function logs a message and exits the loop. \n\n`onAppError` is a function that takes a `message` as input and sends an error status to the server using the `sendStatusError` function. It only runs if the `activeAutomationId` variable is not null. \n\nOverall, the `weave` file provides a way to automate certain tasks in the larger project by fetching commands from a server and executing them using the `eval` function.

The minX and maxX properties represent the minimum and maximum x coordinates, respectively, while the minY and maxY properties represent the minimum and maximum y coordinates, respectively.\n\nThe BoundingBox2D object is intended to be used in the larger project to represent bounding boxes in a 2D space. For example, it could be used to represent the location of objects in an image or video frame. The class_id property could be used to identify the type of object represented by the bounding box, while the scores property could be used to store confidence scores for object detection or classification.\n\nHere is an example of how the BoundingBox2D object could be used:\n\n```\nconst boundingBox: BoundingBox2D = {\n  position: {\n    middle: [50, 50],\n    width: 20,\n    height: 30\n  },\n  class_id: 1,\n  box_caption: 'Example bounding box',\n  scores: {\n    'object_detection': 0.9,\n    'object_classification': 0.8\n  },\n  domain: 'pixel'\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a BoundingBox2D object is created with a middle point at (50, 50), a width of 20, and a height of 30.

These properties are used to construct a URL in the format `/{entityName}/{projectName}/artifacts/{artifactTypeName}/{artifactSequenceName}/{artifactCommitHash}`.\n\nThe `makeNameAndID` function is also included in this file, which is used by the `reportView` function to generate a name and ID for a report. This function takes in an ID and an optional name, and returns a string that combines the two in the format `{encodeURIComponent(name)}--{id}`.

The purpose of this class is to provide an in-memory cache for storing key-value pairs. The cache is implemented using an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm, which means that the least recently used items are removed from the cache when it reaches its maximum size. \n\nThe `InMemoryCache` class takes two generic type parameters: `K` and `IK`. `K` is a type that extends `CacheKey`, which is an interface defined in another file. `IK` is a generic type that can be any object. The `InMemoryCache` class also takes an options object of type `InMemoryCacheOpts` as a constructor argument. This options object specifies the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the cache and a function that maps the cache key to an internal key.\n\nThe `InMemoryCache` class has several methods for interacting with the cache. The `outerKeyToInnerKey` method takes a cache key of type `K` and returns an internal key of type `IK`. The `getKey` method takes an internal key of type `IK` and returns the corresponding value from the cache. The `setKey` method takes an internal key of type `IK`, a value, and an optional time-to-live (TTL) value in seconds, and sets the key-value pair in the cache. The `delKey` method takes an internal key of type `IK` and deletes the corresponding key-value pair from the cache.

Finally, the `reset` method clears the entire cache.\n\nThis class can be used in the larger project to provide a simple in-memory cache for storing frequently accessed data. For example, if the project needs to make expensive API calls to retrieve data, it can cache the results in an instance of `InMemoryCache` to avoid making redundant API calls. Here's an example of how this class might be used:\n\n```\nconst cache = new InMemoryCache({ maxElements: 1000 });\n\nasync function getData(id: number): Promise<Data> {\n  const key = `data-${id}`;\n  const internalKey = cache.outerKeyToInnerKey(key);\n\n  if (cache.hasKey(internalKey)) {\n    return cache.getKey(internalKey);\n  }\n\n  const data = await fetchDataFromApi(id);\n  cache.setKey(internalKey, data, 60); // cache for 60 seconds\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `getData` function first checks if the data for the given ID is already in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached data. Otherwise, it fetches the data from the API and caches it using the `setKey` method. The `outerKeyToInnerKey` method is used to convert the cache key from a string to an internal key that can be used with the cache methods.\n## Questions: \n 1.

For example, they can import the `InMemoryCache` module and create a new cache object like this:\n\n```\nimport { InMemoryCache } from 'weave';\n\nconst cache = new InMemoryCache();\n```\n\nThey can then use the `cache` object to store and retrieve data as needed. Similarly, they can use the `MapCache` module to create a cache object that uses the `Map` data structure, like this:\n\n```\nimport { MapCache } from 'weave';\n\nconst cache = new MapCache();\n```\n\nOverall, these caching modules provide a useful tool for developers working on the weave project to improve application performance by reducing the need to fetch data from slower sources.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `weave` project?**\\\n   Unfortunately, this code snippet alone does not provide enough information to answer this question. It only shows the exports from three different files within the `weave` project.\n   \n2. **What is the difference between `InMemoryCache` and `MapCache`?**\\\n   Again, this code snippet does not provide enough information to answer this question. It only shows that both `InMemoryCache` and `MapCache` are exported from separate files within the `weave` project.\n   \n3. **What is the `Cache` type used for?**\\\n   The `Cache` type is exported from the `types` file within the `weave` project. It is likely used to define the structure and behavior of cache objects used throughout the project.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/cache/index.md"}}],["884",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/cache/mapCache.ts)\n\nThe code above defines a class called `MapCache` that implements a cache using a JavaScript `Map` object. The cache is keyed directly by `CacheKey`, which is a custom type defined in another file. This cache is intended to be used for short-lived, finite execution contexts like map operations.\n\nThe `MapCache` class extends another class called `DependencyAwareCache`, which is also defined in another file. This class provides a set of methods that allow the cache to interact with a dependency graph. However, in this implementation, the `DependencyAwareCache` class is not used for anything other than to provide a type for the `MapCache` class.\n\nThe `MapCache` class has a private property called `map`, which is an instance of a `Map` object. This `map` object is used to store the cached values.\n\nThe `MapCache` class provides several methods for interacting with the cache. The `outerKeyToInnerKey` method simply returns the key passed to it. The `getKey` method retrieves the value associated with the given key from the `map` object and returns it as a promise. The `setKey` method sets the value associated with the given key in the `map` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the value was successfully set. The `delKey` method deletes the value associated with the given key from the `map` object and returns a promise that resolves when the value has been deleted. The `hasKey` method checks whether the given key exists in the `map` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the key exists. Finally, the `reset` method clears the `map` object and returns a promise that resolves when the `map` object has been cleared.\n\nThis `MapCache` class can be used in the larger project to provide a simple cache for short-lived, finite execution contexts. For example, it could be used to cache the results of expensive map operations so that they don't need to be recomputed every time they are needed. Here is an example of how the `MapCache` class could be used:\n\n```\nconst cache = new MapCache();\n\n// Compute the result of an expensive map operation\nconst result = expensiveMapOperation();\n\n// Cache the result\ncache.setKey('myKey', result);\n\n// Retrieve the cached result\nconst cachedResult = await cache.getKey('myKey');\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the `weave` project?\n   This code defines a `MapCache` class that implements a simple map-based cache for short-lived, finite execution contexts like map operations. It is used in the `weave` project to cache data and improve performance.\n\n2. What is the `DependencyAwareCache` class that `MapCache` extends from?\n   The `DependencyAwareCache` class is a generic class that takes two type parameters, `OuterKey` and `InnerKey`, and provides methods for getting, setting, deleting, and checking the existence of cache keys. It is used as a base class for `MapCache` to provide a common interface for different types of caches.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ttlSeconds` parameter in the `setKey` method?\n   The `ttlSeconds` parameter is an optional parameter that specifies the time-to-live (TTL) for the cache key in seconds. If specified, the cache key will expire and be automatically deleted after the specified number of seconds. If not specified, the cache key will remain in the cache until it is manually deleted or the cache is reset.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/cache/mapCache.md"}}],["885",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/.autodoc/docs/json/weave-js/src/core/cache)\n\nThe `cache` folder in the `weave-js/src/core` directory contains implementations of caching mechanisms for the larger weave project. Caching is a technique used to improve application performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch data from slower sources like databases or APIs.\n\nThere are two main cache implementations provided in this folder: `InMemoryCache` and `MapCache`. The `InMemoryCache` class, defined in `inMemory.ts`, provides an in-memory cache using an LRU (Least Recently Used) algorithm. It takes two generic type parameters: `K` (a type that extends `CacheKey`) and `IK` (a generic object type). The class also takes an options object of type `InMemoryCacheOpts` as a constructor argument, specifying the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the cache and a function that maps the cache key to an internal key. The class provides methods for interacting with the cache, such as `outerKeyToInnerKey`, `getKey`, `setKey`, `delKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset`.\n\nHere's an example of how `InMemoryCache` might be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst cache = new InMemoryCache({ maxElements: 1000 });\n\nasync function getData(id: number): Promise<Data> {\n  const key = `data-${id}`;\n  const internalKey = cache.outerKeyToInnerKey(key);\n\n  if (cache.hasKey(internalKey)) {\n    return cache.getKey(internalKey);\n  }\n\n  const data = await fetchDataFromApi(id);\n  cache.setKey(internalKey, data, 60); // cache for 60 seconds\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\nThe `MapCache` class, defined in `mapCache.ts`, implements a cache using a JavaScript `Map` object. This cache is intended for short-lived, finite execution contexts like map operations. The class extends another class called `DependencyAwareCache`, which provides a set of methods for interacting with a dependency graph. The `MapCache` class provides methods for interacting with the cache, such as `outerKeyToInnerKey`, `getKey`, `setKey`, `delKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset`.\n\nHere's an example of how `MapCache` might be used:\n\n```typescript\nconst cache = new MapCache();\n\n// Compute the result of an expensive map operation\nconst result = expensiveMapOperation();\n\n// Cache the result\ncache.setKey('myKey', result);\n\n// Retrieve the cached result\nconst cachedResult = await cache.getKey('myKey');\n```\n\nThe `types.ts` file defines a cache interface and an abstract class, `DependencyAwareCache`, that partially implements the cache interface. This class is intended to be used as a base class for more specific caches and provides a default implementation for handling dependencies. The class requires subclasses to implement methods for converting outer keys to inner keys, deleting keys, setting keys, getting keys, checking if keys exist, and resetting the cache.\n\nIn summary, the `cache` folder provides caching implementations for the larger weave project, allowing developers to store and retrieve data in a performant manner. The `InMemoryCache` and `MapCache` classes can be used to implement caching functionality in various parts of the project, improving application performance by reducing the need to fetch data from slower sources.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/cache/summary.md"}}],["886",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/cache/types.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that defines a cache interface and an abstract class that partially implements the cache interface. The cache interface defines methods for getting, setting, and invalidating cache entries, as well as checking if a key exists in the cache. The interface also includes methods for getting and setting multiple cache entries at once. The cache interface is generic and requires a `CacheKey` type, which is defined as a type alias for a `Node` type from the `GraphTypes` module.\n\nThe abstract class, `DependencyAwareCache`, implements some of the methods from the cache interface and provides a default implementation for handling dependencies. The class is intended to be used as a base class for more specific caches. The class requires subclasses to implement methods for converting outer keys to inner keys, deleting keys, setting keys, getting keys, checking if keys exist, and resetting the cache. The class also defines a `cascadeDelete` method that recursively deletes dependent keys when a key is invalidated.\n\nThe `DependencyAwareCache` class allows the caller to provide downstream dependents and upstream dependencies. When a key is invalidated, it will invalidate all dependent keys. The class uses a `Map` to store the dependency relationships between keys. The `set` method adds dependencies and dependents to the map when a key is set. The `invalidate` method deletes a key and all its dependent keys from the map.\n\nHere is an example of how the `DependencyAwareCache` class might be used:\n\n```typescript\nclass MyCache extends DependencyAwareCache<string, string> {\n  outerKeyToInnerKey(key: string): string {\n    return key;\n  }\n\n  async delKey(key: string): Promise<void> {\n    // delete key from cache\n  }\n\n  setKey(key: string, value: any, ttlSeconds?: number): boolean {\n    // set key in cache\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  getKey(key: string): any {\n    // get key from cache\n  }\n\n  hasKey(key: string): boolean {\n    // check if key exists in cache\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  async reset(): Promise<void> {\n    // reset cache\n  }\n}\n\nconst cache = new MyCache();\ncache.set('key1', 'value1', 60, ['key2'], ['key3']);\ncache.set('key2', 'value2', 60, ['key3'], ['key1']);\ncache.set('key3', 'value3', 60, ['key1'], ['key2']);\ncache.invalidate('key1');\n```\n\nIn this example, a `MyCache` class is defined that extends the `DependencyAwareCache` class. The `outerKeyToInnerKey` method simply returns the key as-is. The `delKey`, `setKey`, `getKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset` methods are implemented to interact with an actual cache. Three keys are set in the cache with dependencies and dependents. When `key1` is invalidated, `key2` and `key3` are also deleted from the cache because they depend on `key1`.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and how does this code fit into it?\n- This code defines an interface and an abstract class for a cache that supports CG execution. It is not clear from this code alone what the overall purpose of the `weave` project is.\n\n2. What is the relationship between `CacheKey`, `MultiSetEntry`, and `GraphTypes.Node`?\n- `CacheKey` is a type alias for `GraphTypes.Node`, which is imported from the `../model/graph/types` module. `MultiSetEntry` is an interface that uses `K extends CacheKey` as a generic type parameter, which means that `MultiSetEntry` can be used with any type that extends `CacheKey`, including `GraphTypes.Node`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `DependencyAwareCache` class and what methods must be implemented by its subclasses?\n- `DependencyAwareCache` is an abstract class that partially implements the `Cache` interface. It provides a default implementation for handling dependencies and requires subclasses to implement several abstract methods, including `outerKeyToInnerKey`, `delKey`, `setKey`, `getKey`, `hasKey`, and `reset`. The key aspect of this class is that it allows the caller to provide downstream dependents and upstream dependencies, and when a key is invalidated, it will invalidate all dependent keys.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/cache/types.md"}}],["887",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/callers.ts)\n\nThe `callFunction` function in the `weave` project is used to construct a new node that represents a function call. It takes two arguments: a `functionNode` and an `inputs` object. The `functionNode` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `inputs` object represents the set of arguments that are passed to the function. The function dereferences variables including walking const functions. It also updates the types when it replaces variables. The `dereferenceVariablesFromFrame` function is used to dereference variables including walking const functions. It takes two arguments: a `functionNode` and a `variables` object. The `functionNode` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `variables` object represents the set of variables that are used in the function. The `dereferenceAllVars` function is used to dereference all variables in a node. It takes two arguments: a `node` and a `stack`. The `node` is a node that terminates at variables or constants, while the `stack` is an array of frames that represent the environment in which the node is evaluated. The `getUnresolvedVarNodes` function is used to get all unresolved variable nodes in a node. It takes one argument: a `node` that terminates at variables or constants. The `mapNodes` function is used to map over all nodes in a node. It takes three arguments: a `node`, a `mapFn` function, and an `excludeFnBodies` boolean. The `mapFn` function is applied to each node in the node, and the `excludeFnBodies` boolean is used to exclude function bodies from the mapping. The `callOpVeryUnsafe` function is used to call an operation with a set of inputs and an output type. It takes three arguments: an `opName`, an `inputs` object, and an `outputType`. The `isFunctionLiteral` function is used to check if a node is a function literal. It takes one argument: a `maybeFunction` node. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { callFunction } from 'weave';\n\nconst add = (a, b) => a + b;\nconst a = 1;\nconst b = 2;\nconst result = callFunction(add, { a, b }); // result is 3\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `callFunction` function?\n- `callFunction` takes a function node and a set of argument nodes, and constructs a new node that represents the function call. It dereferences variables and const functions, and returns the resulting node.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `dereferenceAllVars` function?\n- `dereferenceAllVars` takes a node and a stack, and replaces all variable nodes with their corresponding values in the stack. It also pushes variables into the environment for lambdas, so that when they are encountered in the body, they are swapped for the same variable.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `mapNodes` function?\n- `mapNodes` performs a post-order traversal of a node, and applies a mapping function to each node. It can exclude function bodies from the mapping, and only replaces a node if an input has changed.

The `setPolling`, `isPolling`, `addOnPollingChangeListener`, and `removeOnPollingChangeListener` methods are also pass-through methods that simply call the corresponding methods of the wrapped `Client` object. \n\nThe `query` method is where the caching functionality is implemented. If the cache already contains the result of the query for the given `Node`, the cached result is returned. Otherwise, a new `Promise` is created that subscribes to the `Node` using the wrapped `Client` object, resolves with the result, and then unsubscribes. The result is then cached for future use. \n\nThe `action` method simply calls the `action` method of the wrapped `Client` object. The `loadingObservable` method returns an `Observable` that emits `true` when the client is loading and `false` when it is not. The `refreshAll` method simply calls the `refreshAll` method of the wrapped `Client` object. \n\nFinally, the `debugMeta` method returns an object containing debugging information about the `CachedClient` object, including its `id`, the `debugMeta` of the wrapped `OpStore` object, and the `debugMeta` of the wrapped `Client` object. \n\nOverall, the `CachedClient` class provides a way to reduce the number of network requests made by a client by caching the results of previous queries.

This interface is used to represent an assignment statement in a code block. The `CodeBlock` interface defines an object with a `statements` property, which is an array of `Assignment` objects. This interface is used to represent a block of code containing multiple assignment statements.\n\nThe `newCodeBlock` function returns an empty `CodeBlock` object. This function can be used to create a new code block that can be populated with assignment statements.\n\nThe commented out `declareFunc` function is an example of how to declare a function in the project's code. It takes a `name` string, an `inputTypes` object, an `outputType` string, and a `body` function. The `body` function takes an `inputs` object and returns an `OutputNode` object.

It exports a function called `op` that takes in an `opName` string and returns a function that takes in any number of arguments. The purpose of this function is to provide a way to easily access and execute operations defined in the `StaticOpStore` class.\n\nThe `op` function first checks if the `globalThis` object is defined and if the `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant is set to true. If both conditions are met, it attaches the `op` function to the global object for easy access in the console.\n\nWhen the `op` function is called with an `opName` string, it retrieves the corresponding operation definition from the `StaticOpStore` instance. If the operation definition is not found, it throws a `TypeError`. Otherwise, it creates an object that maps the positional arguments to the input object keys defined in the operation definition. If any positional argument is undefined, it throws a `TypeError`. If the positional argument is not an object, it wraps it in a const node object with the type and value of the argument.\n\nIf the operation definition is low-level, it executes the operation with the input object as the argument and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns null.\n\nThis utility function can be used to quickly test and debug operations defined in the `StaticOpStore` class. For example, if we have an operation called `add` that takes in two numbers and returns their sum, we can use the `op` function to execute it in the console:\n\n```\nop('add')(2, 3); // returns 5\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `StaticOpStore` and `opDefIsLowLevel` imports?\n- The `StaticOpStore` import is used to access the list of all available operations, while the `opDefIsLowLevel` import is used to check if a given operation is low-level or not.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `op` function and how is it used?\n- The `op` function is used for console debugging and takes in an operation name as a parameter. It then returns a function that takes in arguments for the operation and maps them to an input object. If the operation is low-level, it calls the operation with the input object and returns the result.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant and how is it used?\n- The `DEBUG_ATTACH_TO_GLOBAL_THIS` constant is used to determine whether or not to attach the `op` function to the global `this` object for console debugging.

Similarly, the `isTagCreator` function checks if a given `sourceOp` is a tag creator for a specific `targetOpName` by checking its name against a hardcoded list of supported operations and following certain naming conventions. These functions help in determining the relationship between operations in terms of tag consumption and creation.\n\n2. **Question**: What is the role of the `getLambdaFunctionNodes` function, and why are there several hardcoded operations within it?\n   **Answer**: The `getLambdaFunctionNodes` function is responsible for retrieving the lambda function nodes associated with a given `forwardOp`.

A forward graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents a computation graph, where nodes represent operations and edges represent data dependencies between those operations. The forward graph is used to track the flow of data through the computation graph and to perform automatic differentiation.\n\nThe `newForwardGraph()` function creates a forward graph with a `HashingStorage` object, which is a storage implementation that uses a hash table to store nodes and edges. This implementation is efficient for small to medium-sized graphs. The `newRefForwardGraph()` function creates a forward graph with a `RefStorage` object, which is a storage implementation that uses a reference counting scheme to manage memory. This implementation is more memory-efficient for large graphs.\n\nHere is an example of how to use these functions:\n\n```typescript\nimport { newForwardGraph } from 'weave';\n\nconst graph = newForwardGraph();\n\n// Add nodes and edges to the graph\nconst a = graph.addOp('input', []);\nconst b = graph.addOp('input', []);\nconst c = graph.addOp('add', [a, b]);\nconst d = graph.addOp('mul', [c, b]);\n\n// Evaluate the graph\nconst inputs = { [a]: 2, [b]: 3 };\nconst outputs = graph.evaluate([d], inputs);\n\nconsole.log(outputs); // { [d]: 15 }\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a new forward graph using `newForwardGraph()`. We then add four nodes to the graph: two input nodes (`a` and `b`), an addition node (`c`) that depends on `a` and `b`, and a multiplication node (`d`) that depends on `c` and `b`. We then evaluate the graph by passing in the output node (`d`) and an object that maps input nodes to their values. The `evaluate()` method returns an object that maps output nodes to their values.

What is the difference between `HashingStorage` and `RefStorage` and how do they affect the behavior of the forward graph?\n   - `HashingStorage` and `RefStorage` are two different implementations of the storage mechanism for the forward graph. `HashingStorage` uses a hash table to store the values, while `RefStorage` uses a reference-based approach. The choice of storage mechanism can affect the performance and memory usage of the forward graph.\n3.

The primary purpose of this method is to allow quick execution of small graphs, like the ones used in returnType opDefs. Most callers will access this function via the `executeNodeSync` method available in graph.ts.\n\nThe `executeSync` method takes in four parameters: `node`, `nodeResults`, `fg`, and `opStore`. `node` is the node to execute, `nodeResults` is a map of nodes to their results, `fg` is a ForwardGraph, and `opStore` is an OpStore. The method first checks if the result for the given node already exists in `nodeResults`. If it does, it returns the result. If not, it checks the type of the node. If it is an output node, it retrieves the inputs for the node and executes them recursively using `executeSync`. It then retrieves the op definition for the node and checks if it is a low-level op. If it is, it executes the resolver function for the op and sets the result. If it is not a low-level op, it throws an error. If the node is a const node, it simply returns the value of the node.

What are the other queries that this grammar contains?\n   \n   This code includes commented out constants for other queries that this grammar contains, including HIGHLIGHTS_QUERY, INJECTIONS_QUERY, LOCALS_QUERY, and TAGS_QUERY.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/language/js/parser/js-grammar/bindings/rust/lib.md"}}],["915",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/.autodoc/docs/json/weave-js/src/core/language/js/parser/js-grammar/bindings/rust)\n\nThe `lib.rs` file in the `rust` folder provides support for the Weave language in the Tree-sitter parsing library. Tree-sitter is a parsing library that generates syntax trees for source code, making it easier to analyze and manipulate the structure of the code. The Weave language is a custom language that needs to be added to the Tree-sitter parser to enable parsing of Weave code.\n\nThe primary function in this file is `language()`, which returns the Tree-sitter `Language` for the Weave grammar. To use this function, you would first create a new parser using `tree_sitter::Parser::new()`. Then, you would call `parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language())` to add the Weave language to the parser. Finally, you would call `parser.parse(code, None)` to parse some code written in the Weave language. Here's an example of how this code might be used:\n\n```rust\nuse tree_sitter::Parser;\nuse tree_sitter_weave;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new();\n    parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language()).unwrap();\n    let code = \"some Weave code\";\n    let tree = parser.parse(code, None).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", tree.root_node());\n}\n```\n\nThe `NODE_TYPES` constant provides the content of the `node-types.json` file for this grammar. This file defines the types of nodes that can be present in the parse tree for the Weave language. This information is useful for developers who want to analyze or manipulate the parse tree generated by the Tree-sitter parser.\n\nThe code also includes commented-out constants for any queries that this grammar contains. These queries can be used to extract specific information from the parse tree, such as highlighting information or tag information. Developers can uncomment these constants and use them to perform advanced operations on the parse tree.\n\nThe `tests` module includes a single test that verifies that the Weave language can be loaded by a Tree-sitter parser. This test ensures that the Weave language support is functioning correctly and can be used in other parts of the project.\n\nIn summary, the `lib.rs` file in the `rust` folder provides the necessary support for parsing code written in the Weave language using the Tree-sitter parsing library.

Tree-sitter is a parsing library that generates abstract syntax trees (ASTs) for source code, which can be used for various purposes such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and refactoring.\n\nThe `bindings` folder has two subfolders: `node` and `rust`. Each subfolder provides language bindings for different programming languages.\n\n### Node\n\nThe `node` subfolder contains the `binding.cc` file, which defines a function called `tree_sitter_weave()` that returns a pointer to a `TSLanguage` struct, containing information about the syntax of the Weave programming language. The `Init()` function initializes the language binding by creating a new `FunctionTemplate` object, defining a constructor function for the language binding, and creating a new instance of the `Language` class, which is a wrapper around the `TSLanguage` struct.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst Parser = require(\"tree-sitter\");\nconst Weave = require(\"./weave\");\n\nconst parser = new Parser();\nparser.setLanguage(Weave);\n\nconst sourceCode = `\n  function add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst tree = parser.parse(sourceCode);\n\nconsole.log(tree.rootNode.toString());\n```\n\nThe `index.js` file exports a Node.js module called `tree_sitter_weave_binding` and a JSON file called `node-types.json`. The `tree_sitter_weave_binding` module is a native addon that provides a C++ binding for the Tree-sitter parsing library. The `node-types.json` file contains information about the syntax tree nodes produced by the parser.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst parser = require('weave').parser;\nconst sourceCode = '...'; // some `weave` source code\nconst tree = parser.parse(sourceCode);\n\n// Traverse the syntax tree and do something with each node\ntree.walk((node) => {\n  if (node.type === 'function_declaration') {\n    console.log(`Found function: ${node.name}`);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Rust\n\nThe `rust` subfolder contains the `lib.rs` file, which provides support for the Weave language in the Tree-sitter parsing library. The primary function in this file is `language()`, which returns the Tree-sitter `Language` for the Weave grammar.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```rust\nuse tree_sitter::Parser;\nuse tree_sitter_weave;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut parser = Parser::new();\n    parser.set_language(tree_sitter_weave::language()).unwrap();\n    let code = \"some Weave code\";\n    let tree = parser.parse(code, None).unwrap();\n    println!(\"{:?}\", tree.root_node());\n}\n```\n\nThe `NODE_TYPES` constant provides the content of the `node-types.json` file for this grammar.

The grammar is used to parse and analyze the source code written in the `weave` language. It defines various rules, tokens, and constructs that are used to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the source code.\n\nThe grammar is organized into several sections:\n\n1. **Export and Import declarations**: These rules define the syntax for exporting and importing modules in the `weave` language. They include `export_statement`, `import_statement`, and related constructs.\n\n2. **Statements**: This section defines the various types of statements that can be used in the `weave` language, such as `if_statement`, `for_statement`, `while_statement`, and others.\n\n3. **Expressions**: This section defines the various types of expressions that can be used in the `weave` language, such as `assignment_expression`, `binary_expression`, `ternary_expression`, and others.\n\n4. **Primitives**: This section defines the primitive data types and literals in the `weave` language, such as `number`, `string`, `regex`, and others.\n\n5. **Expression components**: This section defines the components that make up expressions in the `weave` language, such as `arguments`, `decorator`, `class_body`, and others.\n\nThe grammar also defines several helper functions, such as `commaSep1` and `commaSep`, which are used to create sequences of elements separated by commas.\n\nHere's an example of how the grammar can be used to parse a simple `weave` code snippet:\n\n```weave\nimport { foo } from './module';\nexport const bar = foo + 1;\n```\n\nThe grammar would parse this code into an AST with nodes representing the import statement, export statement, and the various expressions and identifiers used in the code. This AST can then be used for further analysis, transformation, or code generation.\n## Questions: \n 1. **What is the purpose of the `weave` grammar in this code?**\n\n   The `weave` grammar in this code defines the structure and rules for parsing a programming language or a domain-specific language called \"weave\". It specifies the various constructs, expressions, and statements that are valid in the language, as well as their precedence and associativity.\n\n2. **How are comments handled in this code?**\n\n   Comments are handled using the `comment` rule, which is defined as a token that starts with `/*`, followed by any sequence of characters that does not form the `*/` closing delimiter, and ends with `*/`. This rule allows for C-style multiline comments in the \"weave\" language.\n\n3. **What are the different types of expressions supported in this code?**\n\n   The code supports various types of expressions, including primary expressions, assignment expressions, augmented assignment expressions, await expressions, unary expressions, binary expressions, ternary expressions, update expressions, new expressions, and yield expressions. These expressions can be combined and nested to form more complex expressions in the \"weave\" language.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/language/js/parser/js-grammar/grammar.md"}}],["918",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/language/js/parser/js-grammar/src/scanner.c)\n\nThis file contains an external scanner for the Weave project, which is a C++ library for parsing and manipulating JavaScript code. The purpose of this scanner is to provide additional functionality to the main parser by recognizing certain types of tokens that are not handled by the default scanner provided by the Tree-sitter library.\n\nThe scanner defines four token types: AUTOMATIC_SEMICOLON, TEMPLATE_CHARS, and TERNARY_QMARK. AUTOMATIC_SEMICOLON is used to recognize semicolons that are automatically inserted by the JavaScript interpreter, while TEMPLATE_CHARS is used to recognize template literals (strings enclosed in backticks). TERNARY_QMARK is used to recognize the ternary operator (a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement).\n\nThe scanner is implemented as a set of functions that are called by the main parser when it encounters a token that matches one of the defined types. The functions use the TSLexer interface provided by Tree-sitter to read and manipulate the input stream of characters.\n\nThe scan_template_chars function scans the input stream for a template literal and returns true if one is found. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input stream and looking for the backtick character that marks the end of the literal. Along the way, it also recognizes the ${} syntax used to embed expressions inside the literal.\n\nThe scan_whitespace_and_comments function skips over any whitespace or comments that appear in the input stream. It recognizes both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments.\n\nThe scan_automatic_semicolon function recognizes semicolons that are automatically inserted by the JavaScript interpreter. It does this by looking for certain patterns of characters that indicate the end of a statement. For example, it recognizes semicolons that appear before a closing brace (}), before a comma (,), or before certain operators (+, -, etc.). It also recognizes special cases like the ++ and -- operators, which require a semicolon to be inserted after them.\n\nThe scan_ternary_qmark function recognizes the ternary operator (a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement). It does this by looking for the ? character that marks the beginning of the operator, and then checking for certain patterns of characters that indicate the end of the operator. For example, it recognizes cases where the operator is followed by a period (.) and a digit.\n\nOverall, this scanner provides additional functionality to the main parser by recognizing certain types of tokens that are not handled by the default scanner provided by the Tree-sitter library. This allows the parser to more accurately parse JavaScript code and provide better error messages to the user.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `MemoizedHasher` class implements this interface and provides memoized versions of these methods using the `_.memoize` function from the `lodash` library. Memoization is used to cache the results of previous calls to these methods so that they can be returned quickly if called again with the same arguments.\n\nThe `_typedNodeId` method generates a hash value for a node that includes its type information. This is important because nodes with different types should be considered different entities even if they have the same value.

This is used when we want to identify nodes that have the same value but different types as the same entity. The `_opId` method generates a hash value for an operation that includes the names and input values of the operation.\n\nThe `MemoizedHasher` class also provides a `clear` method that can be used to clear the cache of memoized results. This is useful if we want to regenerate hash values for nodes and operations that have changed.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to generate unique and stable identifiers for nodes and operations in the `weave` project.

Each node type has a corresponding map in the `NormGraph` object that maps the node to a unique ID.\n\nThe `graphNorm` function first initializes an empty `NormGraph` object with empty maps for each node type. It then calls the `visitNode` function with the input node and the `NormGraph` object. The `visitNode` function recursively visits each node in the graph and assigns it a unique ID based on its type. If the node is a constant, variable, or void node, it is added to the corresponding map in the `NormGraph` object.

What is the purpose of the `NormGraph` interface and how is it used in the code?\n- The `NormGraph` interface defines a data structure that maps different types of nodes to unique numerical IDs. It is used to keep track of nodes and their IDs during the normalization process in the `graphNorm` function.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `globalId` variable and how is it used in the code?\n- The `globalId` variable is used to assign unique numerical IDs to nodes as they are visited during the normalization process. It is incremented each time a new ID is needed.\n\n3. Why does the `visitNode` function throw an error with the message \"graphNorm: unknown node type\"?\n- The `visitNode` function is designed to handle four different types of nodes: const, var, output, and void.

It creates a new array that is a copy of the original stack, and then adds each key-value pair from the frame to the beginning of the new array as a new `Frame` object. If the `extra` object is provided, its properties are added to each new `Frame` object.

This is used as a helper function in the other type guards. The `isConstNode`, `isVarNode`, `isOutputNode`, and `isVoidNode` functions are type guards that check if a given node is of a specific type. They do this by checking if the node has a `nodeType` property that matches the expected value. For example, `isConstNode` checks if the node is a `BaseNode` with a `nodeType` of `'const'`.\n\nThe `isNodeOrVoidNode` function is a type guard that checks if a given node is any of the four types of nodes defined in this file (`ConstNode`, `VarNode`, `OutputNode`, or `VoidNode`).

Otherwise, the `union` function from the `helpers` module is called on the `result` array to return a new type that represents the union of all common members.\n\nThe `membersOf` function is a helper function that takes in a `Type` object and returns an array of all its members. If the input type is not a union type, the function simply returns an array containing the input type. If the input type is a union type, the function recursively calls itself on each member of the union and returns a flattened array of all members.\n\nThis code file is likely used in the larger project to handle type intersections between different parts of the codebase. For example, if two functions have different input types but share some common members, the `intersectionOf` function can be used to find the common members and create a new type that represents the intersection of the two input types. This can help ensure that the codebase is consistent and that functions are only called with valid input types. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { intersectionOf } from 'weave';\n\ntype Person = {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n  address: string;\n};\n\ntype Employee = {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n  salary: number;\n};\n\nconst commonMembers = intersectionOf(Person, Employee);\n// commonMembers is now { name: string, age: number }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `intersectionOf` function?\n- The `intersectionOf` function takes in two `Type` objects and returns a new `Type` that represents the intersection of the two input types.\n\n2. What is the `membersOf` function used for?\n- The `membersOf` function takes in a `Type` object and returns an array of `Type` objects that represent the members of the input type.

The `StatusCodeType` is a union type that can only be one of two string literals: 'SUCCESS' or 'ERROR'. The `SpanKindType` is also a union type that can only be one of four string literals: 'LLM', 'CHAIN', 'AGENT', or 'TOOL'. \n\nThe `ResultType` type is an object that has two optional properties: `inputs` and `outputs`. Both properties are objects with string keys and any values. \n\nThe `SpanType` type is an object that represents a span in a trace. It has several optional properties: `span_id`, `name`, `start_time_ms`, `end_time_ms`, `status_code`, `status_message`, `attributes`, `results`, `child_spans`, and `span_kind`. The `span_id` property is a string that uniquely identifies the span. The `name` property is a string that describes the span. The `start_time_ms` and `end_time_ms` properties are numbers that represent the start and end times of the span in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. The `status_code` property is a `StatusCodeType` that represents the status of the span. The `status_message` property is a string that provides additional information about the status. The `attributes` property is an object with string keys and any values that represent metadata associated with the span. The `results` property is an array of `ResultType` objects that represent the inputs and outputs of the span. The `child_spans` property is an array of `SpanType` objects that represent the child spans of the span. The `span_kind` property is a `SpanKindType` that represents the kind of span. \n\nThe `WBTraceTree` type is an object that represents a trace tree. It has two properties: `_type` and `root_span_dumps`. The `_type` property is a string that identifies the type of the object as 'wb_trace_tree'. The `root_span_dumps` property is a string that represents the root span of the trace tree as a serialized `SpanType` object. The `model_hash` and `model_dict_dumps` properties are optional and represent additional information about the trace tree. \n\nThis file is used in the larger weave project to define the types that are used to represent spans and trace trees. These types are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and type safety. For example, a function that creates a new span might take a `SpanType` object as an argument and return a new `SpanType` object. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { SpanType } from 'weave';\n\nfunction createSpan(name: string): SpanType {\n  const span: SpanType = {\n    name,\n    start_time_ms: Date.now(),\n    child_spans: [],\n    span_kind: 'AGENT'\n  };\n  // do some work\n  span.end_time_ms = Date.now();\n  span.status_code = 'SUCCESS';\n  return span;\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `type` argument is a data type defined in the `Types` module, and the `applyFn` argument is a function that takes a `Types.Type` argument and returns a `Types.Type`. The `mappable` function checks if the `type` argument is a list type, and if so, applies the `applyFn` function to the list object type. The resulting list type includes the transformed object type, as well as the minimum and maximum length of the list.

If the `Type` is `'none'`, the function returns `'none'`. If the `Type` is nullable, the function returns a union of `'none'` and the result of applying the `applyFn` function to the non-nullable version of the `Type`.

It takes an opDef and inputs as arguments and returns a type. The function first sets the type to 'any'. If the output type is executable, it replaces the input node with a const node if it has a ConstType. If the output type is a function node, it executes the node synchronously and sets the type to the result. If the output type is a type, it sets the type to the output type.

The `OpDefLowLevel` interface extends `OpDef` and adds a `refineNode` function that can be used to refine the type of a node or create a new node. The `OpDefWeave` interface extends `OpDefBase` and adds a `body` property that represents the op's body, which is constructed only from other ops. The `OpDefGeneratedWeave` interface extends `OpDefBase` and adds an `expansion` function that generates the op's body via a JavaScript function.\n\nThe `OpStore` interface defines a store for ops, which includes methods for registering and retrieving ops, as well as a method for creating ops from `MakeOpDefOpts`. The `MakeOpDefOpts` type defines options for creating an op, including the op's name, argument types, return type, and other metadata such as a description and cache policy.\n\nThe `OpResolverFn` type defines a function that executes an op, given its inputs and a resolver context.

The `opDisplayName` function takes an op and an op store and returns the display name of the op. If the op is binary or unary, the function returns the symbol for the op. If the op name contains a hyphen, the function returns the second part of the name. The `opSymbol` function takes an op and an op store and returns the symbol for the op. If the op does not have a symbolic representation, the function throws an error. The `isUnaryOp` and `isBinaryOp` functions take an op and an op store and return true if the op is unary or binary, respectively. The `isDotChainedOp` function takes an op and an op store and returns true if the op is dot-chained. The `isBracketsOp` function takes an op and an op store and returns true if the op uses brackets. The `isGetAttr` function takes an op and an op store and returns true if the op is the `Object-__getattr__` op.\n\nThe `getOpAssociativity` function takes an op name and returns the associativity of the op. If the op name is `number-powBinary`, the function returns `Side.RIGHT`, otherwise it returns `Side.LEFT`. The `getOpPrecedence` function takes an op name and returns the precedence of the op. The function uses a list of op precedences, where each element of the list is an array of op names with the same precedence. If the op name is not in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the highest possible precedence.\n\nThe `opNeedsParens` function takes an op, a graph, and an op store and returns true if the op needs parentheses to clarify the order of operations given its position in the graph. The function first checks if the op is binary. If it is not, the function returns false. The function then tries to find the output of the op in the graph. If it cannot find the output, the function returns false. The function then finds the consuming op of the output and the index of the argument that corresponds to the output. If it cannot find the consuming op, the function returns false. If the consuming op is dot-chained or uses brackets and the output is the first argument, the function returns true. If the consuming op is dot-chained or uses brackets and the output is not the first argument, the function returns false. The function then checks if the consuming op can steal the output argument.

If it does, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.\n\nThe `findConsumingOp` function takes a node and a graph and returns the consuming op of the node, the index of the argument that corresponds to the node, and the name of the argument. The function first filters the graph to find all output nodes that have the node as an input. If there are no output nodes, the function returns undefined. If there are more than one output nodes, the function throws an error. The function then gets the names and nodes of the arguments of the consuming op and finds the index of the argument that corresponds to the node. The function then returns the consuming op, the index, and the name.\n\nThe `findOutputOf` function takes an op and a graph and returns the output node of the op. The function filters the graph to find all output nodes that have the op as the fromOp property. If there is not exactly one output node, the function throws an error. The function then returns the output node.\n\nThe `nodeIsValidAsNamedArg` function takes an op definition, an argument name, and a possible argument value and returns true if the argument value is valid for the argument name in the op definition. The function first gets the type of the argument from the op definition. If the type is null, the function returns true. Otherwise, the function checks if the type of the argument value is assignable to the type of the argument in the op definition. If it is not, the function returns false. If the type of the argument value is a run type, the function checks if the output type of the run type is assignable to the type of the argument in the op definition. If it is not, the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.\n\nThe `opInputsAreValid` function takes an op inputs object and an op definition and returns true if all of the inputs are valid for the op definition. The function iterates over the entries of the inputs object and checks if each input is valid using the `nodeIsValidAsNamedArg` function. If any input is not valid, the function returns false. Otherwise, the function returns true.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This function can be used to catch errors early on in the development process and prevent them from causing issues later on.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The function then maps over the `arr2` array and returns a new array where each item has a `user_count` property that is divided by the normalization factor.\n\nAn example usage of this function would be:\n\n```javascript\nconst userCounts = [{created_week: new Date(), user_count: 10}, {created_week: new Date(), user_count: 20}];\nconst normalizedCounts = await opMaybeNormalizeUserCounts({arr: userCounts, normalize: true});\nconsole.log(normalizedCounts); // [{created_week: new Date(), user_count: 0.3333}, {created_week: new Date(), user_count: 0.6667}]\n```\n\nIn summary, the `custom` folder in the `weave-js/src/core/ops` directory contains code that handles the normalization of user counts based on certain conditions. The `index.ts` file exports the functionality of the `repo` module, while the `repo.ts` file defines the `opMaybeNormalizeUserCounts` function that normalizes user counts if the `normalize` argument is true.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/ops/custom/summary.md"}}],["972",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/ops/domain/artifact.ts)\n\nThis file contains a set of operations that can be performed on an artifact.

For example:\n\n```\nconst arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nconst obj = spread(arr);\nconsole.log(obj); // { '0': 'a', '1': 'b', '2': 'c' }\n```\n\nThe second function, `generateArrayWithUniformOnes`, generates an array of length `N` with `S` uniformly distributed 1s and the rest 0s. This function can be used to randomly select a subset of elements from an array. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst filter = generateArrayWithUniformOnes(arr.length, 2);\nconst subset = arr.filter((_, i) => filter[i]);\nconsole.log(subset); // [2, 4]\n```\n\nThe third function, `randomlyDownsample`, takes an array `array` and a number `n` and returns a new array with `n` randomly selected elements from the input array. If `n` is greater than or equal to the length of the input array, the function returns the original array. This function can be used to randomly select a subset of elements from an array. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst subset = randomlyDownsample(arr, 2);\nconsole.log(subset); // [2, 4]\n```\n\nOverall, these functions provide useful utilities for manipulating arrays in the `weave` project. The `spread` function can be used to convert arrays into objects with numeric keys, while the `generateArrayWithUniformOnes` and `randomlyDownsample` functions can be used to randomly select subsets of elements from arrays.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This is useful for PanelTable column select expressions during editing, where `index(var('x'))` indicates that the expression will be applied to all rows in the table's underlying array. The resulting type will be a union of the summary types for the first 10 runs in the array. \n\nThe `getStackAtNodeOrOp` function takes a `graph`, `targetNodeOrOp`, `parentStack`, and `opStore` as input and returns the frame (available variables) at `targetNodeOrOp`. This includes the frame provided to the root of the expression, plus any frames added by function literals in which the node was nested. For example, for node `_` in `arr.filter(row => _)`, the frame would be `{arr, row}` (assuming that `arr` was provided at the root). Returns null if the node is not found in `graph`.\n\nThe `jsValToCGType` function takes a JavaScript value `val` and returns a corresponding Codegen type. If `val` is null, the function returns `'none'`. If `val` is a string, number, or boolean, the function returns `'string'`, `'number'`, or `'boolean'`, respectively. If `val` is an array, the function returns a list of the union of the types of its elements. If `val` is a table type history key, the function returns the corresponding file path type. If `val` is a `wb_trace_tree` object, the function returns a type object with `type: 'wb_trace_tree'`. If `val` is an object, the function returns a typed dictionary with the same keys as `val` and values that are the corresponding Codegen types. If `val` is none of the above, the function returns `'unknown'`. \n\nOverall, these functions are used to manipulate and analyze nodes and types within the larger `weave` project.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `replaceInputVariables` function?\n- The `replaceInputVariables` function replaces `runs.index(var('x'))` with `runs.flatten().limit(10)` in the `runNode` graph, which means the resulting type will be a union of the summary types for the first 10 runs in the array.\n\n2. What does the `getStackAtNodeOrOp` function do?\n- The `getStackAtNodeOrOp` function returns the frame (the available variables) at `targetNodeOrOp`, which will be the frame provided to the root of the expression, plus any frames added by function literals in which the node was nested.\n\n3.

The purpose of this code is to allow compute graph functions to take context as their first argument and use methods provided in that context to make API calls. The code also provides two interfaces: FreshContext and ResolverContext.\n\nThe FreshContext interface has two properties: backend and frame. The backend property is of type ServerAPI and represents the server API that the context will use to make API calls.

The `opStore` module is responsible for storing and managing the definitions of operations that can be executed by the `weave` runtime.\n\nThe first function, `opDefIsLowLevel`, takes an `opDef` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the object is an instance of the `OpDefLowLevel` type. This is done by checking whether the `resolver` property of the object is defined. If it is, then the object is considered to be a low-level operation definition.\n\nThe second function, `opDefIsWeave`, takes an `opDef` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the object is an instance of the `OpDefWeave` type. This is done by checking whether the `body` property of the object is defined. If it is, then the object is considered to be a weave operation definition.\n\nThe third function, `opDefIsGeneratedWeave`, takes an `opDef` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the object is an instance of the `OpDefGeneratedWeave` type. This is done by checking whether the `expansion` property of the object is defined. If it is, then the object is considered to be a generated weave operation definition.\n\nThese functions are useful for other parts of the `weave` project that need to work with operation definitions of different types. For example, the `weave` runtime may use these functions to determine how to execute a given operation based on its type. Here is an example of how these functions might be used:\n\n```\nimport { opDefIsLowLevel, opDefIsWeave, opDefIsGeneratedWeave } from 'weave';\n\nconst opDef = getOpDefFromStore('myOp');\n\nif (opDefIsLowLevel(opDef)) {\n  // execute low-level operation\n} else if (opDefIsWeave(opDef)) {\n  // execute weave operation\n} else if (opDefIsGeneratedWeave(opDef)) {\n  // execute generated weave operation\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Unknown operation definition type');\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `getOpDefFromStore` is a function that retrieves an operation definition from the `opStore`. The `if` statement checks the type of the operation definition using the three functions defined in this code, and executes the appropriate code block based on the type. If the type is unknown, an error is thrown.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `OpDef` type and where is it defined?\n- The `OpDef` type is used as a parameter in the three functions defined in this file. It is defined in the `./opStore/types` module.\n\n2. What is the difference between `OpDefLowLevel`, `OpDefWeave`, and `OpDefGeneratedWeave`?\n- These are three different types that are used to narrow down the `OpDef` type in the three functions defined in this file. `OpDefLowLevel` is used when the `opDef` object has a `resolver` property, `OpDefWeave` is used when it has a `body` property, and `OpDefGeneratedWeave` is used when it has an `expansion` property.\n\n3. Why are type assertions used in the return statements of the three functions?\n- Type assertions are used to tell TypeScript that the returned value is of a specific type (`OpDefLowLevel`, `OpDefWeave`, or `OpDefGeneratedWeave`). This is necessary because the functions are narrowing down the `OpDef` type based on the presence of certain properties, but TypeScript cannot infer the specific type without the type assertion.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/runtimeHelpers.md"}}],["1009",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/server/index.ts)\n\nThis code exports several modules and a type from the `weave` project.

The `opStore` property is an instance of the `OpStore` class, which is used to store and manage graph operations. The `engine` property is an instance of the `Engine` class, which is responsible for executing graph operations.\n\nThe `LocalServer` constructor takes three parameters: `cache`, `backend`, and `trace`. The `cache` parameter is an instance of the `Cache` class, which is used to cache graph operations.

The `queryEach` method is similar, but returns a promise that resolves to an array of `PromiseSettledResult` objects. \n\nThe class maintains a `pendingNodes` map that keeps track of nodes that are waiting for a result. When a node is added to the map, a new `NodeEntry` object is created with the node, a resolve function, a reject function, a state of \"waiting\", and a retries count of 0. \n\nThe `flush` method is called periodically on an interval and is responsible for sending requests to the remote server. It first checks if there are too many requests in-flight and if there are, it returns early. It then gets the next batch of waiting nodes, serializes them, and sends them to the remote server. If the server responds with an error status code, the method will retry the request up to a maximum number of times specified in the options. If the server responds with a successful status code, the method will resolve or reject each node based on the response data. \n\nThe class also has methods for resolving and rejecting nodes, as well as a `backoff` method that sets a delay before the next flush. \n\nOverall, this class provides a way to query a remote CG server and handle the (de)serialization of data.

The results are then combined into a single array and returned. The `debugMeta` method returns an object with metadata about the `RoutedServer` object and its `OpStore`. \n\nThese classes are used to enable routing of queries to different servers based on the nodes being queried. This can be useful in a distributed system where different servers may have different capabilities or data.

By using a shadow server, the `ServerWithShadow` instance can detect if the main server is down or returning incorrect results, and switch to using the shadow server instead. This can help prevent downtime and improve the user experience. Additionally, by querying both servers simultaneously, the `ServerWithShadow` instance can improve query performance by returning the result from the main server as soon as it is available, while still allowing the shadow server to continue processing the query in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst mainServer = new MyServer();\nconst shadowServer = new MyServer();\nconst serverWithShadow = new ServerWithShadow(mainServer, shadowServer);\n\nconst nodes = [new Node('node1'), new Node('node2')];\nconst results = await serverWithShadow.query(nodes);\nconsole.log(results);\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the expected return type of the `getRunFileContents` method?\n- The `getRunFileContents` method is expected to return a `Promise` containing the contents of a run file.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/serverApi.md"}}],["1016",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/simplify.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a module that simplifies a given node in a data processing pipeline. The module is contained in a file that imports several other modules, including `client`, `hl`, `model`, `ops`, and `util/filter`. The `simplify` function is the main function in the module, and it takes a `client` object and a `node` object as input. The `node` object represents a node in a data processing pipeline, and the `client` object is used to query the pipeline.\n\nThe `simplify` function simplifies the given `node` object by applying a series of simplification rules. The function first checks if the `node` object is an output node. If it is not, the function returns the `node` object unchanged. If it is an output node, the function applies a series of simplification rules to the `node` object. The function applies these rules until it can no longer simplify the `node` object.\n\nThe simplification rules include removing limit and offset operations prior to index operations, converting groupBy operations to filter operations, and converting index nodes that produce artifacts to project.artifact() nodes. The function also simplifies index nodes that have ancestor groupBy nodes connected by dimension-preserving operations to filter nodes. Finally, the function simplifies index nodes that produce artifactVersion nodes to project.artifactVersion() nodes.\n\nThe `simplify` function calls the `simplifyPass` function to apply the simplification rules to the `node` object. The `simplifyPass` function applies the simplification rules to the `node` object until it can no longer simplify the `node` object. The function then simplifies the inputs of the `node` object by calling the `simplify` function recursively on each input node.\n\nThe `groupByFnToFilterPred` function is used to convert a groupBy function to a filter predicate. The function takes a `groupByFn` object and a `groupKey` object as input. The `groupByFn` object represents a groupBy function, and the `groupKey` object represents a group key. The function returns an output node that represents a filter predicate.\n\nOverall, the `simplify` function simplifies a given node in a data processing pipeline by applying a series of simplification rules. The function uses the `client` object to query the pipeline and applies the simplification rules until it can no longer simplify the `node` object. The function then simplifies the inputs of the `node` object by calling the `simplify` function recursively on each input node.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `groupByFnToFilterPred` function?\n   - The `groupByFnToFilterPred` function converts a groupBy function to a filter predicate that can be used to simplify an index node that is connected to a groupBy node by dimension preserving operations.\n2. What are some simplifications that the `simplifyNode` function implements?\n   - The `simplifyNode` function implements several simplifications, including removing limit and offset ops prior to index ops, converting groupBy.**.index() to filter where ** ops must be dimension preserving, and converting index nodes that produce artifact or artifactVersion to project.artifact() or project.artifactVersion(), respectively.\n3. Under what circumstances will the `simplify` function not attempt to simplify a given node?\n   - The `simplify` function will not attempt to simplify a given node if there are any get-tag calls present in the node, as indicated by the presence of nodes with nodeType 'output' and fromOp name 'group-groupkey'.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/simplify.md"}}],["1017",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/traceTypes.ts)\n\nThe code above defines two types/interfaces that are used in the larger project called \"weave\". The first type is called \"Tracer\" and it is a generic function that takes in two parameters: a string label and a function called \"doFn\". The \"doFn\" function takes in an optional parameter called \"span\" which is of type \"Span\". The purpose of this \"Tracer\" type is to provide a way to trace and log the execution of certain functions in the project. The \"label\" parameter is used to identify the function being traced, while the \"doFn\" parameter is the actual function being traced. The \"span\" parameter is used to provide additional context to the tracing, such as tags or metadata.\n\nThe second interface defined in the code is called \"Span\". It has one method called \"addTags\" which takes in a key-value map of any type and returns the \"Span\" object. The purpose of this interface is to provide a way to add tags or metadata to a tracing span. This can be useful for filtering or searching through the logs later on.\n\nHere is an example of how the \"Tracer\" type can be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nconst tracer: Tracer = (label, doFn) => {\n  console.log(`Tracing function: ${label}`);\n  const span = { addTags: (keyValueMap) => span };\n  const result = doFn(span);\n  console.log(`Function ${label} returned: ${result}`);\n  return result;\n}\n\nfunction myFunction() {\n  // do something\n}\n\ntracer(\"myFunction\", myFunction);\n```\n\nIn the example above, we define a \"tracer\" function that takes in a \"label\" and a \"doFn\" function. Inside the \"tracer\" function, we log the label and create a \"span\" object with the \"addTags\" method. We then call the \"doFn\" function with the \"span\" object as a parameter and log the result. Finally, we return the result of the \"doFn\" function.\n\nWe then define a \"myFunction\" function and pass it to the \"tracer\" function along with a label of \"myFunction\". This will log the execution of the \"myFunction\" function and any additional context provided by the \"span\" object.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `atob` and `btoa` functions are declared to allow for isomorphic behavior, meaning the code can be run in both browser and server environments. \n\nThe `b64ToHex` function takes a base64 string as input and returns a hexadecimal string. It first decodes the base64 string using the `localAtoB` function, which is either the native `atob` function or a custom implementation using the `Buffer` class. It then iterates over each character in the decoded string, converts it to its ASCII code, and converts that code to a two-digit hexadecimal string using `toString(16)`. The `padStart` method is used to ensure that each hexadecimal string is two digits long. The resulting hexadecimal strings are concatenated and returned.\n\nThe `hexToId` function takes a hexadecimal string as input and returns a base64 string. It first iterates over pairs of characters in the input string, converting each pair to its corresponding ASCII character using `parseInt` and `String.fromCharCode`. The resulting ASCII characters are concatenated and encoded as a base64 string using the `localBToA` function, which is either the native `btoa` function or a custom implementation using the `Buffer` class.\n\nThese functions may be used in the larger project to convert between different representations of data, such as when encoding and decoding data for transmission over a network.

The purpose of these functions is to generate URLs and text for documentation pages related to different types of entities in the `weave` project. \n\nThe `urlSafeTypeId` function takes a `typeId` string as input and returns a kebab-cased version of the string. This is necessary because the machine that builds the documentation is case-insensitive, so kebab-casing ensures that the links to the documentation pages are not broken. For example, if `typeId` is \"MyType\", `urlSafeTypeId` will return \"my-type\". \n\nThe `docType` function takes a `typeId` string and an optional `options` object as input, and returns a string that represents the type of entity. If the `options` object has a `plural` property set to `true`, the function returns the plural form of the entity type. For example, if `typeId` is \"W&B Entity\" and `options` is `{plural: true}`, `docType` will return \"W&B Entities\". \n\nIf the `typeId` is in the `TYPES_WITH_PAGES` array, which contains a list of entity types that have documentation pages, `docType` returns a string that includes a link to the documentation page for that entity type.

If the function returns `true` for a given node, that node is added to the result array.\n\nThe `excludeFnBodies` parameter is an optional boolean flag that is used to exclude function bodies from the search. If this flag is set to `true`, the function will not search inside function bodies for additional nodes to include in the result.\n\nThe function first checks if the filter function returns `true` for the initial `node` parameter. If it does, the node is added to the result array. If the node is a constant with a function type and the `excludeFnBodies` flag is not set, the function recursively calls itself on the `val` property of the node.

It calls the `value` function to parse each value, adds the value to the array, skips any whitespace characters, checks if the current character is a `,` (in which case it continues the loop) or a `]` (in which case it exits the loop and returns the array). \n\nThe `string` function parses a string literal by iterating over the characters in the string and building a new string. It first checks that the current character is a `\"`. It then enters a loop that iterates over the remaining characters in the string. If the current character is a `\"`, it exits the loop and returns the string. If the current character is a `\\`, it checks the next character to determine the type of escape sequence (e.g., `\\n` for a newline character). If the next character is a `u`, it parses a Unicode escape sequence and adds the corresponding character to the string. If the next character is not a valid escape sequence, it throws a syntax error. Otherwise, it adds the current character to the string. \n\nThe `number` function parses a number literal by iterating over the characters in the string and building a new string. It first checks if the current character is a `-` (in which case it adds it to the string and checks the next character). It then iterates over the remaining characters in the string and adds them to the string if they are digits. If the current character is a `.`, it adds it to the string and continues iterating over the remaining characters in the string, adding them to the string if they are digits. If the current character is an `e` or an `E`, it adds it to the string and checks the next character. If the next character is a `-` or a `+`, it adds it to the string and checks the next character. It then iterates over the remaining characters in the string and adds them to the string if they are digits. Finally, it converts the string to a number and returns it. \n\nThe `word` function parses a boolean or null literal by iterating over the characters in the string and checking if they match the expected characters. If the current character is a `t`, it checks the next characters to see if they spell `true`. If the current character is an `f`, it checks the next characters to see if they spell `false`. If the current character is an `n`, it checks the next characters to see if they spell `null`. If the current character is an `N`, it checks the next characters to see if they spell `NaN` or `Infinity`. If the current character does not match any of these literals, it throws a syntax error. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reliable and flexible way to parse JSON strings into JavaScript objects. It can be used in a variety of contexts where JSON data needs to be processed, such as web applications that consume JSON APIs or server-side scripts that generate JSON responses. Here is an example usage of the `parseMore` function:\n\n```\nconst jsonString = '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30, \"isMarried\": true}';\nconst parsedObject = parseMore(jsonString);\nconsole.log(parsedObject); // { name: 'Alice', age: 30, isMarried: true }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a modified version of Crockford's JSON.parse that adds support for NaN, -Infinity, and Infinity.\n\n2. What is the role of the `ts-nocheck` and `tslint:disable` comments?\n- The `ts-nocheck` comment disables type checking for the entire file, while the `tslint:disable` comment disables linting for the entire file.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `reviver` parameter in the `parseMore` function?\n- The `reviver` parameter is an optional function that can transform the parsed JSON object before it is returned.

The file imports the `lodash` library and a custom function called `parseMore` from another file in the project. \n\nThe `fixupNaN` function is used to replace strings that represent special floats (such as \"NaN\" or \"Inf\") with their float equivalents in a given object. This function is called by both `JSONparseNaN` and `JSONparseUserFile` to ensure that any special floats in the parsed JSON data are properly converted. \n\nThe `JSONparseNaN` function is used to parse JSON data returned by the server. It first checks if the input string is null or undefined, and returns it if so. Otherwise, it uses the built-in `JSON.parse` function to parse the string into a JavaScript object. It then calls `fixupNaN` to replace any special floats in the object, and returns the resulting object. \n\nThe `JSONparseUserFile` function is used to parse files that were saved by the Python client. These files may contain special floats that cannot be parsed by the built-in `JSON.parse` function, so this function includes a fallback to a custom parser called `parseMore`. If the input string is null or undefined, the function returns an object with an error property set to false and a result property set to null. Otherwise, it attempts to parse the string using `JSON.parse`. If an error is caught, it falls back to `parseMore`. If another error is caught, it returns an object with an error property set to true. If parsing is successful, it calls `fixupNaN` to replace any special floats in the resulting object, and returns an object with an error property set to false and a result property set to the parsed object. \n\nThese functions are useful for parsing JSON data in the `weave` project, particularly when dealing with special floats that may be present in the data. Developers can use these functions to ensure that the parsed data is properly formatted and ready for use in other parts of the project. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```\nconst jsonString = '{\"foo\": \"NaN\", \"bar\": \"Inf\"}';\nconst parsedData = JSONparseNaN(jsonString);\nconsole.log(parsedData); // {foo: NaN, bar: Infinity}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

Why does the `JSONparseUserFile` function use a custom JSON parser?\n   \n   The `JSONparseUserFile` function uses a custom JSON parser because some files saved by the Python client may contain NaNs and infinities that the browser built-in parser cannot handle.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `JSONparseNaN` and `JSONparseUserFile` functions?\n   \n   The `JSONparseNaN` function is used to parse data returned by the server, while the `JSONparseUserFile` function is used to parse files saved by the Python client.

These functions can be used throughout the project to perform common tasks. \n\nThe `notEmpty` function is a type predicate that checks if a value is not null or undefined. This function is especially useful when filtering arrays, as it can be used to filter out null or undefined values. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr = ['a', null, 'b'];\nconst filteredArr = arr.filter(notEmpty);\n// filteredArr is ['a', 'b']\n```\n\nThe `notArray` function is another type predicate that checks if a value is not an array. This can be useful when working with functions that expect a non-array value. \n\nThe `isObject` function checks if a value is an object. This function uses the `isObject` method from the Lodash library to perform the check. \n\nThe `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function recursively maps over an object or array and applies a function to each value. If the value is an array, the function is applied to each item in the array. If the value is an object, the function is applied to each value in the object. For example:\n\n```\nconst obj = {\n  a: [1, 2, 3],\n  b: {\n    c: 4,\n    d: [5, 6, 7]\n  }\n};\n\nconst mappedObj = deepMapValuesAndArrays(obj, (val) => val * 2);\n// mappedObj is {\n//   a: [2, 4, 6],\n//   b: {\n//     c: 8,\n//     d: [10, 12, 14]\n//   }\n// }\n```\n\nThe `zip` function takes multiple arrays and returns an array of objects where each key is the index of the input arrays and each value is the corresponding value at that index. For example:\n\n```\nconst arr1 = [1, 2, 3];\nconst arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nconst zippedArr = zip(arr1, arr2);\n// zippedArr is [\n//   {0: 1, 1: 'a'},\n//   {0: 2, 1: 'b'},\n//   {0: 3, 1: 'c'}\n// ]\n```\n\nThe `shallowEqual` function checks if two objects are equal by comparing their keys and values. This function only performs a shallow comparison, meaning it does not compare nested objects or arrays. \n\nThe `toIncludesObj` function takes an array of strings and returns an object where each key is a string from the input array and each value is `true`. This function can be useful when checking if a string is included in a list of strings. For example:\n\n```\nconst list = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\nconst includesObj = toIncludesObj(list);\n// includesObj is {a: true, b: true, c: true}\n\nconst str = 'b';\nif (includesObj[str]) {\n  console.log(`${str} is included in the list`);\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `notEmpty` and `notArray` functions?\n- The `notEmpty` function checks if a value is not null or undefined, and returns a type predicate. The `notArray` function checks if a value is not an array, and returns a type predicate.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function?\n- The `deepMapValuesAndArrays` function recursively maps over an object or array, applying a given mapping function to each value, and returns a new object or array with the mapped values.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `zip` function and the `DeArray` and `Pivot` types?\n- The `zip` function takes any number of arrays and returns a new array of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is taken from the first array, the second element is taken from the second array, and so on. The `DeArray` type is a utility type that extracts the element type of an array. The `Pivot` type is a utility type that takes an array of arrays and returns an array of objects, where each object has a property for each index of the input arrays, and the value of each property is the corresponding element from the input arrays.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/util/obj.md"}}],["1029",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/util/path.ts)\n\nThe code provided consists of two functions, `baseName` and `extension`, which are used to extract the base name and extension of a file path, respectively. \n\nThe `baseName` function takes a string parameter `path` which represents the file path and splits it into an array of strings using the forward slash `/` as the delimiter. It then returns the last element of the array, which represents the base name of the file. \n\nFor example, if the input `path` is `/home/user/documents/file.txt`, the function will return `file.txt`.\n\nThe `extension` function also takes a string parameter `path` and uses the `baseName` function to extract the file name. It then splits the file name into an array of strings using the period `.` as the delimiter and returns the last element of the array, which represents the file extension.\n\nFor example, if the input `path` is `/home/user/documents/file.txt`, the function will return `txt`.\n\nThese functions can be used in a larger project to extract file names and extensions for various purposes such as file manipulation, filtering, or sorting. For instance, if a project requires filtering files based on their extensions, the `extension` function can be used to extract the extension of each file and compare it to a list of accepted extensions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst filePath = '/home/user/documents/file.txt';\nconst fileName = baseName(filePath); // returns 'file.txt'\nconst fileExtension = extension(filePath); // returns 'txt'\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `baseName` function?\n   - The `baseName` function takes a string `path` and returns the last part of the path after splitting it by `/`, which is essentially the file or directory name.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `extension` function?\n   - The `extension` function takes a string `path` and returns the file extension of the file in the path by first calling the `baseName` function to get the file name and then splitting it by `.` to get the last part, which is the extension.\n\n3. Are there any potential issues with this code?\n   - One potential issue with this code is that it assumes that the file path contains a file name with an extension. If the path is a directory path or a file path without an extension, the `extension` function will return an empty string or an incorrect value.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/util/path.md"}}],["1030",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/util/pineapple.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file that exports a function called `pineapple` and another function called `unpineapple`. The `pineapple` function takes an object and returns a new object that is a \"pineapple\" representation of the original object. The `unpineapple` function takes a \"pineapple\" object and returns the original object. \n\nThe `pineapple` function takes two arguments: `food` and `optsIn`. `food` is the object to be transformed into a \"pineapple\" object. `optsIn` is an optional object that can be used to customize the behavior of the function. The `pineapple` function returns an object that has two properties: a property with the key specified in the `optsIn` object (or the default key if none is specified) that contains a reference to the root object, and a `refs` property that contains an array of all the objects in the original object graph. \n\nThe `unpineapple` function takes two arguments: `encoded` and `optsIn`. `encoded` is the \"pineapple\" object to be transformed back into the original object. `optsIn` is an optional object that can be used to customize the behavior of the function. The `unpineapple` function returns the original object. \n\nThe `pineapple` function works by creating a new object that has the same structure as the original object, but with all the objects replaced by references to those objects. The `unpineapple` function works by replacing all the references in the \"pineapple\" object with the actual objects they refer to. \n\nThe `pineapple` function uses an `ObjectNormalizer` class to create a map of all the objects in the original object graph. The `ObjectNormalizer` class has a `normalize` method that takes an object and returns a `NormObjectMap`. The `normalize` method works by recursively visiting all the objects in the original object graph and assigning each object a unique ID. The `NormObjectMap` is a `Map` that maps each object in the original object graph to its unique ID. \n\nThe `pineapple` function then uses the `invertRemap` function from the `invertRemap` module to create a new object that has the same structure as the \"pineapple\" object, but with all the references replaced by the actual objects they refer to. The `invertRemap` function takes the `NormObjectMap` created by the `ObjectNormalizer` class and a callback function that is called for each object in the original object graph. The callback function takes two arguments: the object and its unique ID. The `invertRemap` function returns a new object that has the same structure as the \"pineapple\" object, but with all the references replaced by the actual objects they refer to. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `pineapple` and `unpineapple` functions:\n\n```javascript\nimport { pineapple, unpineapple } from 'weave';\n\nconst obj = {\n  foo: 'bar',\n  baz: {\n    qux: [1, 2, 3],\n  },\n};\n\nconst pineappleObj = pineapple(obj);\n\nconsole.log(pineappleObj);\n// { \"🍍\": { \"🍍\": 0 }, \"refs\": [ { \"foo\": \"bar\", \"baz\": { \"qux\": [ 1, 2, 3 ] } }, { \"qux\": [ 1, 2, 3 ] } ] }\n\nconst unpineappledObj = unpineapple(pineappleObj);\n\nconsole.log(unpineappledObj);\n// { foo: 'bar', baz: { qux: [ 1, 2, 3 ] } }\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `ObjectNormalizer` class?\n- The `ObjectNormalizer` class is used to create a flat map of objects that may still be nested.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `pineapple` function?\n- The `pineapple` function is used to serialize a JavaScript object into a JSON-compatible format.\n\n3.

The hook returns an object with three properties: `visible`, `onScroll`, and `onMouseMove`. \n\nThe `visible` property is a boolean that indicates whether the scrollbar should be visible or not. The `onScroll` property is a function that sets the `visible` property to `true` when called. The `onMouseMove` property is a function that takes a `MouseEvent` object as an argument and checks if the mouse is outside the container element. If the mouse is outside the container element, the `makeScrollbarVisible` function is called, which sets the `visible` property to `true`. \n\nThe `makeScrollbarVisible` function is a memoized function that uses the `throttle` method from the Lodash library to limit the number of times it can be called within a certain time frame. When called, it sets the `visible` property to `true` and sets a timeout to hide the scrollbar after 2 seconds. If the function is called again before the timeout is complete, the previous timeout is cleared and a new one is set. \n\nThis hook can be used in a larger project to provide a more user-friendly interface for scrolling through content. By showing the scrollbar only when necessary, the interface can be less cluttered and more visually appealing. The hook can be used in conjunction with other React components to create a custom scrolling experience that meets the needs of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useScrollbarVisibility } from 'weave';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { visible, onScroll, onMouseMove } = useScrollbarVisibility();\n\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{ overflowY: 'scroll' }}\n      onScroll={onScroll}\n      onMouseMove={onMouseMove}\n    >\n      {visible && <div style={{ height: '20px' }} />}\n      <div style={{ height: '1000px' }}>Content goes here</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the `weave` project?\n   - This code exports a custom hook called `useScrollbarVisibility` that returns an object with properties related to scrollbar visibility. It is likely used in components that require scrollbar visibility functionality.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?\n   - The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize a throttled function that sets the `resultsScrollbarVisible` state to `true` and schedules a timeout to set it back to `false` after 2 seconds. This is used to show and hide the scrollbar based on user interaction.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `handleMouseMove` function and how is it used?\n   - The `handleMouseMove` function is a callback function that is called when the user moves the mouse over a container element. It checks if the mouse is outside the container and calls the `makeScrollbarVisible` function to show the scrollbar. This function is passed as a prop to the container element to handle mouse move events.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/core/util/scrollbar.md"}}],["1032",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/core/util/string.ts)\n\nThe `weave` project contains a file with several utility functions that can be used throughout the project. \n\nThe `splitOnce` function takes in a string and a delimiter and returns an array with two elements. The first element is the substring before the first occurrence of the delimiter, and the second element is the substring after the delimiter. If the delimiter is not present in the string, the second element of the array is null. This function can be used to split a string into two parts based on a specific character or substring.\n\nThe `splitOnceLast` function is similar to `splitOnce`, but it splits the string on the last occurrence of the delimiter instead of the first. If the delimiter is not present in the string, the function returns an array with two null values.\n\nThe `stripQuotesAndSpace` function takes in a string and removes any leading or trailing spaces or quotes. This function can be used to clean up user input or data from an external source.\n\nThe `sanitizeGQLAlias` function takes in a string and replaces any non-letter, non-number, or non-underscore characters with double underscores. This function is specifically designed to sanitize strings that will be used as aliases in GraphQL queries, as the GraphQL spec only allows letters, numbers, and underscores in aliases.\n\nThe `capitalizeFirst` function takes in a string and returns the same string with the first letter capitalized. This function can be used to format strings in a consistent way.\n\nThe `isValidEmail` function takes in a string and returns true if the string matches the pattern of a valid email address. This function can be used to validate user input or data from an external source.\n\nThe `removeNonASCII` function takes in a string and removes any non-ASCII characters. This function can be used to clean up user input or data from an external source.\n\nThe `indent` function takes in a string and a number representing the indentation level, and returns the same string with the specified number of spaces added to the beginning of each line. This function can be used to format strings in a consistent way, such as when printing debug information or generating code. \n\nOverall, these utility functions provide a set of tools that can be used throughout the `weave` project to manipulate and format strings in various ways.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It takes a generic type `T` as an argument and returns a value of type `T | undefined`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the previous value and the `useEffect` hook to update the reference when the value changes. This hook can be used to compare the current value of a state with its previous value and perform some action based on the comparison.\n\nThe `useDeepMemo` hook is another custom hook that returns a new value only if the value changes by deep comparison from one call to the next. It takes a generic type `T` and an optional function `equalityFn` as arguments and returns a value of type `T`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the previous value and the `usePrevious` hook to get the previous value. If the current value is not equal to the previous value based on the `equalityFn` function, it updates the reference with the current value. This hook can be used to optimize the performance of a component by memoizing a value that is expensive to compute.\n\nThe `useGatedValue` hook is a custom hook that returns `true` when a given value becomes `onScreen` for the first time after a certain condition is met. It takes a generic type `T` and a function `updateWhen` as arguments and returns a value of type `T`. It uses the `useRef` hook to store the current value and updates the reference only if the value changes and the `updateWhen` function returns `true`. This hook can be used to trigger an action when a certain value becomes visible on the screen.\n\nThe `useSyncedState` hook is a custom hook that synchronizes the state of a component with the state of another component. It takes an object with two properties, `stateToSyncWith` and `setStateToSyncWith`, as an argument and returns an object with two properties, `state` and `setState`. It uses the `useState` hook to initialize the state and the `useEffect` hook to update the state when the `stateToSyncWith` changes. It also uses the `useCallback` hook to create a function that updates both states when the `setState` function is called.

If the operation is a `__getattr__` operation, it generates a special description for retrieving the specified attribute. It also generates descriptions for each of the operation's arguments by iterating over the `argDescriptions` object of the `opDef` object and sanitizing and generating HTML for each description.

It renders the display name, description, argument descriptions (if any), and return value description. The descriptions are rendered as sanitized HTML using the `S.Markdown` component. The component also includes a `data-test` attribute for testing purposes and a `onMouseDown` event handler to prevent the component from taking focus and disappearing before the `onClick` event can register.\n\nOverall, the `OpDoc` component provides a reusable way to generate documentation for operations in the Weave project. It can be used in conjunction with other components to provide a comprehensive documentation experience for users. Here is an example usage of the `OpDoc` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport OpDoc from 'weave/components/OpDoc';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <OpDoc opName=\"add\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component also provides various keyboard shortcuts, such as pressing \"Enter\" to execute the expression, and pressing \"Tab\" to select a suggestion.\n\nOverall, the `WeaveExpression` component provides a powerful and flexible text editor for writing expressions in the Weave language, with support for syntax highlighting, suggestions, and execution. The component is designed to be used in the larger Weave project, and can be easily customized and extended to meet the needs of different users and use cases.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `WeaveExpression` component?\n- The `WeaveExpression` component is a React functional component that renders a Slate editor with additional functionality for editing and running Weave expressions.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useWeaveExpressionState` hook?\n- The `useWeaveExpressionState` hook is used to manage the state of the `WeaveExpression` component, including the Slate editor value, suggestions, and expression validity.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Suggestions` component?\n- The `Suggestions` component is a child component of `WeaveExpression` that renders a list of suggestions for completing the current expression, based on the user's input.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/panel/WeaveExpression/index.md"}}],["1047",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/panel/WeaveExpression/leaf.tsx)\n\nThe code provided is a React component called `Leaf` that is used as a leaf node in a Slate editor. The purpose of this component is to apply class names to the text based on the marks applied to it. \n\nWhen a user applies a mark to a text in the editor, such as bold or italic, Slate applies that mark to the corresponding leaf node. This component takes the `leaf` object as a prop and applies class names to the text based on the keys in the `leaf` object. \n\nThe `reduce` function is used to iterate over the keys in the `leaf` object and apply class names based on the key. If the key is `text`, it is ignored. If the key is an operator such as `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `!`, or `%`, the class name `operator` is added. If the key is `true` or `false`, the class name `boolean` is added. Otherwise, the key itself is added as a class name. \n\nThe resulting array of class names is then filtered to remove duplicates using the `Set` object. Finally, the `span` element is rendered with the `attributes` and `children` props passed down from the `Editable` component. The `className` prop is set to the unique class names joined by a space. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to customize the appearance of text in the editor based on the marks applied to it. For example, if a user applies the bold mark to text, the resulting HTML will have a `span` element with the class name `bold`. This allows for easy styling of the text using CSS. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport {Editor, Transforms} from 'slate';\nimport {Slate, Editable, withReact} from 'slate-react';\nimport {Leaf} from 'weave';\n\nconst MyEditor = () => {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState([\n    {\n      type: 'paragraph',\n      children: [{text: 'Hello, world!'}],\n    },\n  ]);\n\n  const renderLeaf = useCallback(props => <Leaf {...props} />, []);\n\n  return (\n    <Slate value={value} onChange={newValue => setValue(newValue)}>\n      <Editable renderLeaf={renderLeaf} />\n    </Slate>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Leaf` component?\n    \n    The `Leaf` component is a leaf component passed to the `renderLeaf` prop of the `Editable` component in Slate.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `classes` variable and how is it generated?\n    \n    The `classes` variable is an array of class names generated by iterating over the keys of the `leaf` object and checking if they match certain conditions. The purpose of this is to apply any marks on the leaf as class names.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `uniqueClasses` variable?\n    \n    The `uniqueClasses` variable is an array of unique class names generated from the `classes` array. The purpose of this is to ensure that each class name is only applied once to the `span` element.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/panel/WeaveExpression/leaf.md"}}],["1048",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/panel/WeaveExpression/state.ts)\n\nThe `WeaveExpressionState` class is responsible for managing the state of a Weave expression editor. It takes in a set of props, including the current expression, a function to set the expression, and a flag indicating whether to live-update the expression. It also takes in a `WeaveInterface` object, a `Stack` object, a `Slate` editor object, and several callback functions.\n\nThe class has several private properties, including a counter for instances of the class, a function to trace messages, and several state variables. The state variables include an ID, a flag indicating whether the editor is busy, a flag indicating whether the expression is valid, a flag indicating whether the expression has been modified, the current editor value, the current suggestions, the current syntax tree, and a flag indicating whether the editor is initializing.\n\nThe class has several methods for handling different types of events. The `handleStackChanged` method is called when the stack changes and processes the current text. The `handleEditorChanged` method is called when the editor changes and updates the editor value and processes the new text. The `handleExprChanged` method is called when the expression changes and updates the editor text. The `handleSetExprChanged` method is called when the set expression changes and updates the set expression function. The `handleFlushPendingExpr` method is called when the pending expression is flushed and updates the expression state.\n\nThe `processText` method processes the current text and updates the parse state. The `processParseState` method updates the expression and suggestions based on the parse state. The `processSuggestionTarget` method updates the suggestions based on the current suggestion target. The `updateExpr` method updates the expression based on the current parse state and editor text. The `updateSuggestions` method updates the suggestions based on the current parse tree and editor state.\n\nThe `set` method updates a public attribute of the class and sets a flag indicating that changes have been made. The `postUpdate` method updates the state of the class based on the current state and calls the stateUpdated callback function.\n\nOverall, the `WeaveExpressionState` class manages the state of a Weave expression editor and provides methods for handling different types of events and updating the state of the editor.

These functions and types are used to manage the state of the component and to interact with other parts of the `weave` project.\n\nThe `Suggestions` component takes a single prop, `props`, which is an object that contains several properties, including `items`, `suggestionIndex`, `typeStr`, and `isBusy`. These properties are used to determine which suggestions to display and how to display them.\n\nThe component uses the `useWeaveContext` hook to get access to the `weave` object, which is used to take suggestions when the user selects one. It also uses the `useSuggestionVisualState` and `useSuggestionTakerWithSlateStaticEditor` hooks to manage the state of the component and to take suggestions when the user selects one.\n\nThe component renders a list of suggestions using the `props.items` array. Each suggestion is rendered as an `li` element with a `key` attribute set to the index of the suggestion in the `props.items` array. When a suggestion is clicked, the `takeSuggestion` function is called with the selected suggestion as an argument.\n\nThe component also renders an optional `div` element that displays the type of the suggestion (`props.typeStr`) and an optional `S.StyledOpDoc` component that displays documentation for the selected suggestion.\n\nFinally, the component uses the `createPortal` function from `react-dom` to render the suggestions in a separate DOM node outside of the component's parent. This is done to prevent the suggestions from being clipped by the parent's boundaries.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport {Suggestions} from 'weave/components/suggestions';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const items = [\n    {suggestionString: 'foo', newNodeOrOp: {fromOp: {name: 'bar'}}},\n    {suggestionString: 'baz', newNodeOrOp: {fromOp: {name: 'qux'}}},\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" />\n      <Suggestions items={items} suggestionIndex={0} typeStr=\"string\" isBusy={false} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

What is the purpose of the `getTimeSegmentsInTimeZone` function and how does it work?\n- The function returns an object with the current hour, minute, and second in a specified time zone.\n- It uses the `toLocaleTimeString` method with the specified time zone and options to format the current time in that time zone, and then parses the resulting string to extract the hour, minute, and second.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/time.md"}}],["1056",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/types.ts)\n\nThe code defines several interfaces and a type that are used in the larger weave project. The `ExpressionResult` interface defines an object that contains an `EditingNode` and optional properties such as a `Parser.SyntaxNode`, a `Map` of `EditingNode`s, and extra text. This interface is likely used to represent the result of parsing and evaluating an expression in the weave project.\n\nThe `PanelSpec` interface defines an object that represents a panel in the weave project. It contains properties such as an `id`, a `displayName`, a `Component` that is a React component, an `inputType` that is a `Type`, an optional `outputType` function, a `canFullscreen` boolean, and a `defaultFixedSize` that is either a `Dimensions` object or a function that returns a `Dimensions` object. This interface is likely used to define the properties and behavior of panels in the weave project.\n\nThe `Dimensions` interface defines an object that contains a `width` and a `height`, both of which are either numbers or undefined. This interface is likely used to represent the dimensions of a panel or other UI element in the weave project.\n\nThe `PanelProps` interface defines an object that contains an `input` of type `I`, a `config` of type `C`, an optional `updateInput` function that takes a partial `I` and returns void, and an `updateConfig` function that takes a partial `C` and returns void. This interface is likely used to pass properties and functions to a panel component in the weave project.\n\nOverall, this code defines interfaces and a type that are used to represent and define panels and expressions in the weave project. These interfaces and type are likely used throughout the project to ensure consistency and type safety. Here is an example of how the `PanelSpec` interface might be used to define a panel component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { PanelSpec, PanelProps, Type } from '@wandb/weave/core';\n\ninterface MyPanelConfig {\n  title: string;\n}\n\nconst MyPanel: React.FC<PanelProps<Type, MyPanelConfig>> = ({ input, config, updateConfig }) => {\n  const { title } = config;\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      <p>Input type: {input}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => updateConfig({ title: 'New Title' })}>Change Title</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nconst myPanelSpec: PanelSpec<Type, MyPanelConfig> = {\n  id: 'my-panel',\n  displayName: 'My Panel',\n  Component: MyPanel,\n  inputType: Type.String,\n  outputType: (inputType) => inputType,\n  canFullscreen: true,\n  defaultFixedSize: { width: 400, height: 300 },\n};\n\nexport default myPanelSpec;\n```\n\nIn this example, a panel component called `MyPanel` is defined that takes an input of type `Type` and a config of type `MyPanelConfig`. The component renders a title from the config, the input type, and a button that updates the config. A `myPanelSpec` object is also defined that uses the `MyPanel` component and sets various properties such as the input type and default size. This `myPanelSpec` object can then be used elsewhere in the weave project to create and display the `MyPanel` component.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` project and what does this file specifically do?\n- The `weave` project is being imported and this file exports interfaces and types related to expressions and panel specifications.\n2. What is the relationship between `PanelSpec` and `PanelProps`?\n- `PanelSpec` defines the specifications for a panel, including its input and output types, while `PanelProps` defines the props that a panel component should receive, including the input and config.\n3. What is the significance of the `canFullscreen` property in `PanelSpec`?\n- The `canFullscreen` property determines whether a panel can expand to fill the available vertical space in its parent and restrict content from overflowing, or if it should expand vertically based on the size of its content.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/types.md"}}],["1057",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave-js/src/util.ts)\n\nThe code in this file provides utility functions for the Weave project, specifically related to the Weave expression language. \n\nThe `shouldSkipOpFirstInput` function takes an `OpDef` object as input and returns a boolean indicating whether certain op styles should receive their first input from the left-hand side (LHS) of the expression, rather than as an input parameter. The function checks the `type` property of the `renderInfo` object within the `OpDef` object to determine whether it is one of the styles that should skip the first input.

It then defines a class called `WeaveApp` that extends the `Weave` class. The `WeaveApp` class has a constructor that takes a `Client` object as an argument and passes it to the `Weave` constructor using the `super` keyword. It also initializes an empty array called `panelSpecs`.\n\nThe `WeaveApp` class has a single method called `panel` that takes a string argument called `id`. This method searches the `panelSpecs` array for an object with an `id` property that matches the `id` argument. If it finds a match, it returns the object. If it doesn't find a match, it throws an error.\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a way to create a `Weave` application with a set of `PanelSpec` objects that can be accessed by their `id` values. The `Weave` class provides a framework for building interactive visualizations, and the `PanelSpec` interface defines the properties of a panel that can be added to a `Weave` application. The `WeaveApp` class extends the `Weave` class and adds a method for retrieving a `PanelSpec` object by its `id`. This can be useful for dynamically updating the contents of a panel based on user input or other events.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:\n\n```typescript\nimport {Client} from '@wandb/weave/core';\nimport {WeaveApp} from './weave-app';\nimport {PanelSpec} from './components/Panel2/panel';\n\nconst client = new Client();\nconst weaveApp = new WeaveApp(client);\n\nconst panelSpecs: PanelSpec[] = [\n  {id: 'panel1', title: 'Panel 1', content: 'This is the content of panel 1'},\n  {id: 'panel2', title: 'Panel 2', content: 'This is the content of panel 2'},\n  {id: 'panel3', title: 'Panel 3', content: 'This is the content of panel 3'},\n];\n\nweaveApp.panelSpecs = panelSpecs;\n\nconst panel1 = weaveApp.panel('panel1');\nconsole.log(panel1.title); // Output: \"Panel 1\"\n\nconst panel2 = weaveApp.panel('panel2');\nconsole.log(panel2.content); // Output: \"This is the content of panel 2\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `Client` object and use it to create a `WeaveApp` object. We then define an array of `PanelSpec` objects and assign it to the `panelSpecs` property of the `WeaveApp` object. Finally, we use the `panel` method of the `WeaveApp` object to retrieve individual `PanelSpec` objects by their `id` values and log their properties to the console. This demonstrates how the `WeaveApp` class can be used to manage a set of `PanelSpec` objects in a `Weave` application.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `Weave` and `Client` imports from `@wandb/weave/core`?\n   - The `Weave` import is a class that is being extended by the `WeaveApp` class, and the `Client` import is being passed as a parameter to the `WeaveApp` constructor.\n2. What is the `panelSpecs` property and how is it being used?\n   - `panelSpecs` is an array of `PanelSpec` objects that is being initialized in the `WeaveApp` constructor and used in the `panel` method to find a panel with a specific ID.\n3. Why is there a TODO comment about moving an implementation to the `cg` package?\n   - It is unclear from the code snippet what the `cg` package is and what implementation is being referred to, so a smart developer might want to investigate further or consult with other team members to understand the context and reasoning behind the comment.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/src/weave.md"}}],["1059",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/.autodoc/docs/json/weave-js)\n\nThe `weave-js` folder contains various TypeScript and JavaScript files, as well as configuration files for the Weave project.

Why is the `react` plugin only enabled in development mode?\n    \n    The `react` plugin is only enabled in development mode because it requires Babel, which is slow. To make sure the behavior is the same in both environments, the new JSX runtime is not used in development mode. Instead, the classic runtime is used, which is equivalent to the production environment where JSX transpilation is handled by esbuild.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `alias` array in the Vite configuration?\n    \n    The `alias` array is used to allow absolute imports inside the `weave` package. It maps module names to file paths, so that when a module is imported using a certain name, Vite knows where to find the corresponding file. It also maps some third-party modules to different paths, for example `react-datetime` and `react-virtualized`.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave-js/vite.config.md"}}],["1066",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave.egg-info/dependency_links.txt)\n\nThe code in this file is responsible for defining a class called `Weave`. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to weave together multiple lists of data into a single list. The `Weave` class has a constructor that takes in any number of lists as arguments. These lists are stored as instance variables within the `Weave` object.\n\nThe `Weave` class has a method called `weave` that takes no arguments and returns a list. This method is responsible for weaving together the lists that were passed to the constructor. The resulting list is created by iterating over the lists in a round-robin fashion. This means that the first element of the first list is followed by the first element of the second list, then the first element of the third list, and so on. Once all the first elements have been added to the resulting list, the second elements are added in the same fashion, and so on until all the elements have been added.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Weave` class can be used:\n\n```\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nlist2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nlist3 = [True, False, True]\n\nw = Weave(list1, list2, list3)\nresult = w.weave()\n\nprint(result) # Output: [1, 'a', True, 2, 'b', False, 3, 'c', True]\n```\n\nIn this example, three lists are created and passed to the `Weave` constructor. The resulting `Weave` object is then used to call the `weave` method, which returns a single list that contains all the elements from the three input lists, woven together in a round-robin fashion. This resulting list is then printed to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of the `weave` function?\n   \n   The `weave` function takes in two linked lists and weaves them together by alternating nodes from each list. The resulting linked list will have nodes from both input lists in an alternating pattern.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Node` class?\n   \n   The `Node` class represents a single node in a linked list. It has two properties: `data`, which stores the value of the node, and `next`, which points to the next node in the list.\n\n3. What is the time complexity of the `weave` function?\n   \n   The time complexity of the `weave` function is O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in the input linked lists. This is because the function iterates through each node in both lists exactly once to create the new, woven linked list.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/weave.egg-info/dependency_links.md"}}],["1067",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/wandb/weave/weave.egg-info/requires.txt)\n\nThis code is a list of dependencies required for the Weave project.
